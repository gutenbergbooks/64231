</div>


<p>History is the record made by men and women; so
the story of the western plains is the story of Buffalo
Bill and of those other hard workers who with their
deeds and even with their lives bought the great country
for the use of us to-day.</p>

<p>The half of what Buffalo Bill did, in the days of
the Overland Trail, has never been told, and of course
cannot be told in one short book. He began very
young, before the days of the Overland Stage; and he
was needed long after the railroad had followed the
stage. The days when the Great Plains were being
opened to civilized people required brave men and
boys—yes, and brave women and girls, too. There
was glory enough for all. Everything related in this
book happened to Buffalo Bill, or to those persons who
shared in his dangers and his deeds. And while he
may not remember the other boy, Dave Scott, whom
he inspired to be brave also, he will be glad to know
that he helped Davy to be a man.</p>

<p>That is one great reward in life: to inspire and
encourage others.</p>

OVERLAND TRAIL</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="I">I<br />
<small>TALL BULL SIGNALS: “ENEMIES!”</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Since early dawn forty Indians and one little red-headed
white boy had been riding amidst the yellow
gullies and green table-lands of western Nebraska,
about where the North Platte and the South Platte
Rivers come together. The most of these Indians were
Cheyennes; the others were a few Arapahoes and two
or three Sioux. The name of the little red-headed
boy was David Scott.</p>

<p>He was guarded by the two squaws who had been
brought along to work for the thirty-eight men. They
worked for the men, little Dave worked for <em>them</em>;
and frequently they struck him, and told him that
when the Cheyenne village was reached again he would
be burnt.</p>

<p>In the bright sunshine, amidst the great expanse
of open, uninhabited country, the Indian column, riding
with its scouts out, made a gallant sight. The
ponies, bay, dun, black, white, spotted, were adorned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
with paint, gay streamers and jingly pendants. The
men were bareheaded and bare bodied; on this warm
day of June they had thrown off their robes and
blankets. But what they lacked in clothing, they supplied
in decoration.</p>

<p>Down the parting of the smoothly-combed black
hair was run vermilion; vermilion and ochre and blue
and white and black streaked coppery forehead, high
cheek-bones and firm chin, and lay lavishly over brawny
chest and sinewy arms. At the parting of the braids
were stuck feathers—common feathers for the braves,
tipped eagle feathers for the chiefs. The long braids
themselves were wrapped in otter-skin and red flannel.
From ears hung copper and brass and silver
pendants. Upon wrists and upper arms were broad
bracelets and armlets of copper. Upon feet were
beaded moccasins worked in tribal designs. The fashion
of the paint and the style of the moccasins it was
which said that these riders were Cheyennes.</p>

<p>The column had no household baggage and no
children (except little Dave) and no dogs; and it had
no women other than just the two. The men were
painted and although they rode bareheaded, from the
saddle-horn of many tossed crested, feathered bonnets
with long tails. These were war-bonnets. All
the bows were short, thick bows. These were war-bows.
All the arrows in the full quivers were barbed
arrows. Hunting arrows were smooth. The lances
were tufted and showy. The shields, slung to left<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
arm, were the thick, boastfully painted war shields.
The ponies were picked ponies; war ponies. Yes,
anybody with half an eye could have read that this
was a war party, not a hunting party or a village on
the move.</p>

<p>Davy could have proven it. Wasn’t he here, riding
between two mean squaws? And look at the
plunder, from white people—some of it from his own
uncle and aunt, all of it from the “whoa-haw” trains,
as the Indians had named the ox-wagon columns of
the emigrants and freighters.</p>

<p>Ever since, two weeks back, these Cheyennes had
so suddenly out-charged upon his uncle’s wagon and
another, strayed from the main column, they had been
looking for more “whoa-haws.” This year, 1858, and
the preceding half dozen years had been fine ones for
Indians in search of plunder. Thousands of white
people were crossing the plains, between the Missouri
River and the Rocky Mountains; their big canvas-covered
wagons contained curious and valuable things,
as well as women and children. They were drawn by
cattle and horses or mules, and behind followed large
bands of other cattle and horses and mules. Sometimes
these “whoa-haw” people fought stoutly, sometimes
they had no chance to fight—as had been the
case with little Dave’s uncle.</p>

<p>Tall Bull was the young chief in charge of the
squad that had attacked the two wagons. Now Tall
Bull was one of the scouts riding on the flanks and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
ahead of the war party, so as to spy out the country.
In his two weeks with the Cheyennes Dave had learned
them well. They were no fools. They rode cunningly.
They were disciplined. While they kept to the low
country their scouts skirted the edges of the higher
country, in order to see far. By wave of blanket or
movement of horse these keen-eyed scouts could
signal back for more than a mile, and every Indian in
the column could read the signs. Then the head chief,
Cut Nose, would grunt an order, and his young men
would obey.</p>

<p>The march was threading the bottom of a bushy
ravine. Cut Nose, head chief, led; Bear-Who-Walks
and Lame Buffalo, sub-chiefs, rode with him. Behind
filed the long column. In the rear of all trailed the
two squaws, guarding the miserable Davy.</p>

<p>Suddenly adown the column travelled, in one great
writhe, a commotion. A scout, to the right, ahead,
was signalling. He was Tall Bull. His figure, of
painted self and mottled pony, was plainly outlined just
at the juncture of brushy rim and sky. Now he had
dismounted, and had crept forward, half stooped, as
if the better to see, the less to be seen. But back he
scurried, more under cover of the ravine edge; standing
he snatched his buffalo robe from about his waist
and swung it with the gesture that meant “Somebody
in sight!”</p>

<p>He sprang to his spotted pony, and down he came,
riding in a slow zigzag and making little circles, too.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
The slow zigzag meant “No hurry” and the little
circles meant “Not many strangers.” And he signed
with his hand.</p>

<p>However, large party or small party, the news
was very welcome. All the other scouts sped to see
what Tall Bull had seen. From side ravines out rushed
at gallop the little exploring detachments. ’Twas
astonishing how fast the news spread. The two squaws
jabbered eagerly; and the aides of Cut Nose went
galloping to reconnoitre.</p>

<p>As for Cut Nose himself, he halted, and thereby
halted the column, while he composedly sat to receive
reports. The rear gradually pressed forward to hear,
and the squaws strained their ears. Davy could not
understand, but this is what was said, by sign and
word, when Tall Bull had arrived:</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“White men, on horses.”</p>

<p>“How many?”</p>

<p>“Three.”</p>

<p>“How far?”</p>

<p>“A short pony ride.”</p>

<p>“What are they doing?”</p>

<p>“Travelling.”</p>

<p>“Any baggage?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Are they armed?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Guns.”</p>

<p>Cut Nose grunted. Now Lame Buffalo, sub-chief,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
came scouring back. He had seen the three men. It
was as Tall Bull had said. Two of the men were
large, one was small. They were riding mules, and
were dressed in “whoa-haw” clothes, so they were
not trappers or hunters, but probably belonged to that
“whoa-haw” train of many men that the column had
sighted travelling east. They were riding as if they
wished to catch it. But they could be reached easily,
said Lame Buffalo, his black eyes blazing. Blazed the
black eyes of all; and fiercest were the snappy black
eyes of the two squaws. The three “whoa-haws”
could be reached easily by following up a side ravine
that would lead out almost within bow-shot. Then
the white men would be cut off in the midst of a flat
open place where they could not hide.</p>

<p>“Good,” grunted Cut Nose; and he issued short,
rapid orders. Little Dave had not understood the words
but he could understand the gestures and signs that
made up more than half the talk; and he could understand
the bustle that followed. The Cheyennes, the
few Arapahoes and Sioux, were preparing themselves
for battle.</p>

<p>Blankets and robes were thrown looser. Leggings
were kicked off, to leave the limbs still freer. The
rawhide loops by which the riders might hang to the
far side of their ponies were hastily tested. Quivers
were jerked into more convenient position. Arrows
were loosened in them. The unstrung bows were
strung. The two warriors who had old guns freshened<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
the priming and readjusted the caps upon the nipples.
Several of the younger warriors hurriedly slashed face
and chest anew with paint. War bonnets were set
upon heads; their feathered tails fell nearly to the
ground.</p>

<p>With a single eagle glance adown his force Cut
Nose, raising his hand as signal, dashed away up the
ravine. After him dashed all his array, even to the
two squaws and little Dave.</p>

<p>Braids tossed, hoofs thudded, war bonnets
streamed, and every painted rider leaned forward, avid
for the exit and the attack. Dave’s heart beat high.
He was afraid for the white men. The Cheyennes
were so many, so eager, and so fierce.</p>

<p>The scouts before kept signing that all was well.
The white men evidently were riding unconscious of a
foe close at hand. At the side ravine Cut Nose darted
in. Its farther end was closed by brush and low plum
trees, which rose to fringe the plateau above. A scout
was here, peering, watching the field. He was Yellow
Hand, son of Cut Nose. He signalled “Come! Quick!
Enemy here!”</p>

<p>Thus urged, up the slope galloped Cut Nose, Lame
Buffalo, Bear-Who-Walks; galloped all. At the
top, emerging, Cut Nose flung high his hand, shaking
his war bow. Over the top after him poured the racing
mass, savage in paint and cloth and feather and
decorated weapon. Swept onward with them rode little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
Dave, jostled between the two squaws, who whipped
his pony as often as they whipped their own.</p>

<p>The halloo of Cut Nose rose vibrant.</p>

<p>“Hi-yi-yi-yi-yi; yip yip yip!” he whooped, exultant
and threatening.</p>

<p>“Hi-yi-yi-yi-yi; yip yip yip!” yelped every rider,
the squaws chiming in more piercingly than any others.</p>

<p>Out from the plum tree grove and into the plateau
they had burst, and went charging furiously.</p>

<p>The sun was shining bright, for the day was
glorious June. The plateau lay bare, save for the grass
dried by weather and the few clumps of sage and
greasewood. And there they were, the three whites,
stopped short, staring and for the moment uncertain
what to do.</p>

<p>They were alone, between bending blue sky and
wide plain; a little trio in the midst of a vast expanse.
As the scouts had claimed, no shelter was near. At
the other edge of the plateau flowed the North Platte
River, but too distant to be reached now.</p>

<p>Louder pealed the whoops of the warriors, louder
shrieked the shrill voices of the squaws, as onward
charged, headlong, the wild company, to ride over the
white dogs and snatch scalp and weapon.</p>

<p>Almost within gunshot swept forward the attack.
Already had spoken, recklessly, with “Bang! Bang!”
the guns in the hands of the two excited warriors.
Were the white men going to run, or stand? They
were going to stand, for they had vaulted to ground.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
One of them was small enough to be a boy. Three
puffs of blue smoke jetted from them. The leading
Indians ducked low—but the shots had not been for
them! Look! Down had dropped the three mules, to
lie kicking and struggling.</p>

<p>The white men (yes, one was a boy!) bent over
them, stoutly dragging and shoving; and next, in behind
the bodies they had crouched. Only the tops of
their broad hats and their shoulders could be described,
and their gun muzzles projecting before. This, then,
was their fort: the three dead mules arranged in
triangle! Evidently the two men, and perhaps the boy,
had fought Indians before. Davy felt like cheering;
but from the forty throats rang a great shout of rage
and menace. The squaws had halted, with Dave, to
watch; unchecked and unafraid the warriors forged
on, straight for the little barricade.</p>

<p>“Kill! Kill!” shrieked the squaws, glaring.</p>

<p>The warriors were shooting in earnest; arrows
flew, the two guns again belched. The charge seemed
almost upon the fort, when from it puffed the jets
of smoke. “Bang! Bang! Bang!” drifted dully the
reports; and with scarce an interval followed other jets,
rapid and sharp: “Bang! Bang-bang! Bang! Bang!”</p>

<p>From the painted, parted lips of the two squaws issued
a wilder, different note, and little Dave again
felt like cheering; for from their saddles had lurched
three of the Cheyennes, and a pony also had pitched
in a heap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span></p>

<p>Cut Nose swerved; he and every warrior flung
themselves to the pony side opposite the fort, and
parting, the column split as if the fort were a wedge.
In two wings they went scouring right and left of it.
Around and around the mule-body triangle they rode,
at top speed, in a great double circle, plying their bows.</p>

<p>Their arrows streamed in a continuous shower,
pelting the fort. They struck, quivering, in the mule
bodies and in the ground. Now from every savage
throat rang another shout—high, derisive. On their
ponies the squaws capered, and shook their blanket
ends. An arrow was quivering in a new spot—the
shoulder of one of the whites. Now Davy felt like
sobbing. But it was not in the shoulder of the boy;
it was in the shoulder of the man beyond him, and
facing the other way. However, that was bad enough.</p>

<p>Still, the man was not disabled; not he. His gun
remain levelled, and neither the boy nor the other
man paid any attention to him. The three occasionally
shot, but lying low against their ponies’ sides the
Indians, galloping fast, were hard to hit.</p>

<p>Cut Nose raised his hand again, and from the circle
he veered outward. The circle instantly scattered,
and after their chief galloped every warrior.</p>

<p>Forward hammered the two squaws, with vengeful
look at little Dave which bade him not to lag. The
warriors had gathered in a group, out of gunshot from
the fort. Cut Nose was furious. Indians hate to lose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
warriors; and there were three, and a pony, stretched
upon the plain.</p>

<p>“Are you all old women?” scolded Chief Cut
Nose, while Dave tried to guess at what was being
shouted, and his two guardians pressed to the edge
of the circle. “You let three whites, one of whom is
very little, beat us? The dogs will bark at us when we
go back and the squaws will whip us through the
village. Everybody at home will laugh. They will
say: ‘These are not Cheyennes. They are sick
Osages! They are afraid to take a scalp, and when
an enemy points a stick at them, they run!’ Bah! Am
I a chief, and are you warriors, or are we all ghosts?”</p>

<p>Panting, the warriors listened. They murmured
and shrugged, as the words stung.</p>

<p>“Those whites shoot very straight. The little one
shoots the straightest of any. They must have many
guns. They shoot once and without loading they shoot
again,” argued Lame Buffalo.</p>

<p>“You talk foolish,” thundered Cut Nose. “These
whites cannot keep shooting. All we need to do is to
charge swift and not stop, and when we reach them
their guns will be empty. Shall Cheyennes draw back
and leave three brothers and a good pony lying on the
prairie? These whites will go on and join their whoa-haw
train, and tell how they three, from behind dead
mules, fought off the whole Cheyenne nation! Or shall
we send our squaws against them, to kill them! The
little white boy will laugh,” and he pointed at Dave.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
“He will not want to be a Cheyenne; he will stay
white. Cheyennes are cowards.”</p>

<p>Through the jostling company ran a hot murmur;
but Lame Buffalo, especially scolded, almost burst.</p>

<p>“No!” he yelled. “Cheyennes are not cowards!
I am a Cheyenne. I can kill those three whites myself.
I will go alone. I ask no help.”</p>

<p>He whirled his pony; he burst from the dense ring,
and tossing high his plumed lance, with a tremendous
shout he launched himself straight for the mule fort.
He did not ride alone; no, indeed! Answering his
shout, and imitating his gesture, every warrior followed,
vying to outstrip him. Now woe for the whites.
Dave’s heart beat so as well-nigh to choke him. His
eyes leaped to the fort.</p>

<p>The two men and the boy in the little triangle had
been busy. They had rearranged the carcasses to give
more protection; the arrow had been pulled from the
shoulder of the wounded man; he was as alert as if he
had not been hurt at all; and over the mule bodies
jutted the gun muzzles, trained upon the Indian charge.</p>

<p>Could that tiny low triangle formed by three dead
mules outlast such a yelling, tearing mob, sweeping
down upon it? Could it beat back Lame Buffalo alone—that
splendid feather-crowned horseman, riding like
a demon, shouting like a wolf? He still led, and with
every few jumps of his pony he shook his lance and
whooped.</p>

<p>Well might those three whites in the mule triangle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
be afraid, at last; and who could blame the boy, there,
if he, particularly, was afraid? It was a bad place
for a boy. Dave watched him anxiously, and wondered.</p>

<p>The boy was facing toward the charge; the two
men also were facing outward, to right and left of
him, that they might cover the charge as it spread.</p>

<p>Up rose the boy’s gun; the two men seemed to be
waiting upon him. He was aiming, but he would not
shoot yet, would he, with the Indians so far off?</p>

<p>Yet, he shot! His gun muzzle puffed smoke. The
squaws started, cried out, waved frantic hands—for
three hundred yards from the muzzle had toppled,
toppled from his pony, Lame Buffalo, smitten in mid-course!
It seemed to Dave that he could hear the
two white men cheering; but to the cries of the squaws
were added the terrific yells of the warriors, drowning
out every other sound.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, that was a long, long shot, for boy
or man; and a <em>good</em> shot. The charge split again; and
not daring even to pick up Lame Buffalo, who was
crawling painfully and pressing a hand to his side,
it circled around and around the mule fort, as before.</p>

<p><a href="#i_frontis">As Lame Buffalo had said, the “little one” shot
the straightest of any.</a></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="II">II<br />
<small>THE HERO OF THE MULE FORT</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Cut Nose signalled his band to council again. Four
warriors had fallen, and two ponies. Now at a safe
distance from that venomous, spit-fire little fort, they
all dismounted, except for a few scouts, and squatted
for a long confab.</p>

<p>“Kill! Kill!” implored the two squaws.</p>

<p>“Shut up!” rebuked Cut Nose; and they only
wailed about the dead.</p>

<p>On the outskirts of the council, and annoyed by
the wailing of the squaws, Dave could not hear all
the discussion. Cut Nose asked the sub-chiefs for
their opinion what to do; and one after another spoke.</p>

<p>“There is no use in charging white men behind a
fort,” said Bear-Who-Walks. “We lose too many
warriors, any one of whom is worth more than all the
white men on the plains. It is not a good way to
fight. I like to fight, man to man, in the open. If we
wait long enough, we can kill those three whites when
their hearts are weak with thirst and hunger.”</p>

<p>“They have medicine guns,” declared Yellow
Hand. “They have guns that are never empty. No
matter how much they shoot, they can always shoot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
more. The great spirit of the white people is helping
them. It is some kind of magic.”</p>

<p>At this, Dave wanted to laugh. The two white
men and the white boy were shooting with revolvers
that held six loads each, and the Cheyennes could not
understand. The only guns that the Indians had were
two old muskets which had to be reloaded after every
shot.</p>

<p>“We will wait,” said Cut Nose. “We have
plenty of time. The whoa-haws in front will travel on,
leaving these three whites. We will wait, and watch,
and when they have eaten their fort and their tongues
are hanging out for water, we will ride to them and
scalp them before they die. That is the easiest way.”</p>

<p>Some of the warriors did not favor waiting; the
two squaws wept and moaned and claimed that the
spirits of the slain braves were unhappy because those
three whites still lived. But nobody made a decisive
move; they all preferred to squat and talk and rest
their ponies and themselves.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in the mule body triangle the two men
and the boy had been busy. They did not waste any
time, talking and boasting. It was to be seen that they
were digging hard with their knives, and heaping the
dirt on top of the mule bodies, and between them. An
old warrior noted this.</p>

<p>“See,” he bade. “The fort is stronger than ever.
But by night the wind will change and we can make
the whites eat fire. That is a good plan.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” they agreed. “Let us wait till dark.
White men behind a fort in daytime are very hard to
kill. There is no hurry.”</p>

<p>The afternoon passed. The Indians chewed dried
buffalo meat, and squads of them rode to the river and
watered the horses. While lounging about they
amused themselves by yelling insults at the mule fort;
and now and again little charges were made, by small
parties, who swooped as close as they dared, and shot
a few arrows.</p>

<p>The two men and the boy rarely replied. They,
also, waited. Their barricade was so high, that in the
trench behind it they were completely sheltered.</p>

<p>But over them and over the field of battle constantly
circled two great black buzzards. Lame Buffalo
had ceased to crawl, and lay still. The squaws
begged the young warriors to go out and bring him in—him
and the other stricken braves. The young men
only laughed and shook their heads. One did dash forward;
but a bullet from the gun of the boy grazed his
scalp-lock, and ducking he scurried back faster than
he had gone!</p>

<p>That boy certainly was cool and brave and sharp-sighted.
Dave was proud of him; for Dave, also, was
white, and a boy.</p>

<p>So the afternoon wore away. Evening neared.
The sun, a large red ball, sank into the flat plains. A
beautiful golden twilight spread abroad, tinging the
sod and the sky. The world seemed all peaceful; but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
here in the midst of the twilight were waiting and
watching the painted Cheyennes, as eager as ever to
get at those three persons in the mule fort. This twilight,
Dave imagined, must be a very serious moment
for the fort. The twilight warned that night was at
hand.</p>

<p>Dusk settled, and deepened into darkness. The
Sioux made no camp-fires. Davy wrapped himself in
an old buffalo-robe, and guarded by the two squaws,
one on either side of him, tried not to sleep. As he
listened, while he gazed up at the million stars, and the
plains breeze fanned across his face, he wondered what
the boy in the mule fort was doing. No doubt he was
listening, too, and wishing that the stars would come
down and help, or else send a message to those freight
wagons which were travelling on.</p>

<p>Davy must have dropped off to sleep, in spite of
himself; because suddenly he was aroused by the
squaws sitting up and jabbering. Had morning come?
The plains yonder were light. No; that was fire!
The Cheyennes, just as they had planned, had set the
grass afire, to windward of the mule fort. While
Davy, too, sat up, his heart beating wildly, the fire
seemed to be sweeping right toward the fort. Behind
the line of flames and smoke he could see the dark
figures of the Indians fanning with blankets and robes,
to make the line move faster and fiercer.</p>

<p>“Humph! A poor fire,” grunted one of the
squaws. “Grass too short.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span></p>

<p>“Yes. But it makes a smoke, so the men can
charge up close,” answered the other.</p>

<p>That, then, was the scheme, if the fire itself did not
amount to much. Some of the dark figures behind the
line of fire fanned; others were stealing forward, into
the smoke itself. The moment was exciting. The
smoke was drifting across the fort; would the two men
and the boy suspect that the Indians were following
it in?</p>

<p>The line of fire seemed almost at the low mound
which contained the three whites; the smoke drifted
thick and fast; the figures of the Indians stole forward.
Abruptly, from the dim mound spurted a jet
of flame, and sounded a hollow “Bang!” Another
jet spurted, with another “Bang!” And—“Bang!
Bang! Bangity-bang-bang!” Hurrah! That fort
was not being fooled; no, indeed. It was ready for
anything. It knew what was behind the smoke, and
had only been waiting.</p>

<p>“Kill! Kill!” shrieked the two squaws, enraged
again. But the warriors gave up, as soon as they found
that their smoke scheme had not worked. They shot
their bullets and a few arrows, and lay low. Soon
the fire and the smoke had passed beyond the mule fort.
Some of the braves returned to the camp; the others
continued to sneak about, on guard over the fort.
Silence reigned.</p>

<p>“We might as well go to sleep,” said one squaw
to the other. “Nothing will happen until morning.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span></p>

<p>“Lie down, white red-head,” bade the second
squaw, roughly, to Dave. “To-morrow we will have
three more whites, and that will mean lots of fun.”</p>

<p>Davy obeyed. It was warmer lying down than sitting
up. Thankful that the three whites were still
unbeaten, and too smart for the Cheyennes, he fell
asleep. When again he wakened, it really was morning.
The sky was pink, and stars pale, the brush
showed plainly. But he had no time to meditate, or
invite another “forty winks.” The squaws had
sprung to their feet; the air was full of clangor and
shouting and shooting; the Indians were making a
charge, the little fort was holding them off.</p>

<p>It was the angriest charge yet, all in the chill, pink
dawn flooding high sky and broad plain. However,
it didn’t work. The two men and the boy were just
as ready as ever, and the charge split. Cut Nose
waved his hand and motioned. The circle of galloping
horsemen spread wider, and dismounting, the
riders, holding to their ponies’ neck-ropes, sat down
to wait like a circle of crows watching a corn-field.</p>

<p>The two squaws were disgusted. They grumbled,
as they prepared breakfast; and under their scowls
Davy felt afraid. He wondered what the Indians
would do next.</p>

<p>Plainly enough, they did not intend to make any
more charges. The sun rose high and higher. His
beams were hot, so that the plain simmered. Without
shade in that little open enclosure formed by the mule<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
carcasses, the three whites would soon be very uncomfortable.
One was a boy and one was wounded. Circling
and waiting, the two black buzzards had been
joined by a third. Forming a wide ring of squatting
warriors and dozing ponies, the Indians also waited.
The air was still; scarcely a sound was to be heard,
save as now and then the squaws with Davy murmured
one to the other, or a warrior made a short remark.</p>

<p>What was to be the end? The grim siege was worse
than the charges. The sun had climbed well toward
the noon mark, and Davy felt heart-sick for those
three prisoners in the mule fort, when, on a sudden, a
new thing happened. First, a warrior, on his right,
up-leaped, to stand gazing westward, listening. Another
warrior stood—and another, and another. Cut
Nose himself was on his feet; ponies were pricking
their ears; the two squaws, bounding to their feet,
likewise looked and listened.</p>

<p>Davy strained his ears. Hark! Distant shooting?
Flat, faint reports of firearms seemed to drift through
the stillness. No! Hurrah, hurrah! Those reports
were the cracking of teamsters’ bull-whips. A wagon
train was coming! Another wagon train, from the
west! See—above that ridge there, only half a mile
away, a wagon already had appeared: first the team
of several span of oxen, then the white top of the big
vehicle itself, and the driver trudging, and several outriding
horsemen flanking on either side.</p>

<p>Team after team, wagon after wagon, mounted the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
ridge, and flowed over and down. It was a large train,
and a grand sight; only, it was not a grand sight for
the Indians. But in the mule fort the two white men
and the boy had jumped up and were waving their hats
and cheering. Davy wanted to join, and wave and
cheer.</p>

<p>To their ponies’ backs were vaulting all the Indians.
The two squaws, panic-stricken, rushed to the
safety of their saddles. They seemed to forget little
Dave. Cut Nose had dashed to the front, his men
were rallying around him. Evidently they were debating
whether to fight or run. Louder sounded the
smart cracks of the bull-whips; the wagon train was
coming right ahead, lined out for the very spot. The
Indians had short shift for planning. The two squaws,
having hastily gathered their belongings, galloped for
the council. Davy started to follow, but lagged, and
paused. His own pony was making off, dragging his
neck rope, to catch up with the other ponies. Davy
wisely let him go.</p>

<p>Now Cut Nose raised his hand; and turning, quickened
his pony to a furious gallop. Shrill pealed his
war-whoop; whooping and lashing, after him pelted
every warrior, with the two squaws racing behind.
Straight for the little fort they charged. The three
whites had dropped low, to receive them. And—look,
listen—from the wagon train welled answering yell,
and on, across the plain, for the fort, spurred a dozen
and more riders shaking their guns and shouting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span></p>

<p>Davy dived to cover of a greasewood bush, and lay
low. But the Cheyennes did not stop to get him. They
kept on; at the little fort they split, as before, and
shooting and yelping they passed on either side of it.
The three whites received them with a volley and sent
a volley or two after them as they thudded away. And
that was the end of the siege.</p>

<p>Davy did not dare to stand and show himself. To
be sure, the Cheyennes, both men and squaws, were
racing away, as hard as they could ride; but even yet
they might send back after him. So he lay and peeped.
However, in the mule fort the two men and the boy had
risen upright, again to wave and cheer. Waving and
cheering, the mounted men from the wagon train came
galloping on, and presently the three in the fort stepped
outside. Arrived, the foremost riders from the train
hastily flung themselves from their saddles, and there
was apparently a great shaking of hands and exchange
of greetings. With volleys renewed, from their whip
lashes, the teams also were hastening for the scene.
The Cheyennes already were almost out of sight. So
Davy stood, and trudged forward.</p>

<p>He had half a mile to walk, through the low brush.
The first of the wagons beat him to the fort. When he
drew near, the lead wagon had halted, and the others
were trundling in one after the other. The men were
crowding about their three comrades who had been
rescued, and for a few moments nobody seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
notice ragged little red-headed Dave, toiling on as fast
as he could.</p>

<p>It was a large train. There were twenty-five
wagons, with their teamsters, and about two hundred
extra men, some mounted on mules and horses. However,
most of the men were afoot. The wagons were
tremendous big things, with flaring canvas tops on, or
else with the canvas stripped, leaving only the naked
hoops of the frame-work. Each wagon was drawn by
twelve panting bullocks, yoked in pairs, or spans.</p>

<p>The majority of the men were dressed alike, in
flat, broad-brimmed plains hats, blue or red flannel
shirts, and rough trousers belted at the waist and tucked
into high, heavy boots. The teamsters were armed
in hand with their whips, of short stock and long lash
and snapper which cracked like a pistol shot. Those
cracks could be heard half a mile. The extra men
carried mainly large bore muskets, called (as Davy
knew) Mississippi yagers; and all had knives and pistols,
thrust into waist-band and belt. Whiskered and
unshaven and tanned and dusty, it was a regular rough-and-ready
crowd.</p>

<p>However, of course the three defenders of the mule
fort took the chief attention. They were the two men
(the shoulder of one was rudely bandaged with a blue
bandanna handkerchief) and the boy. Even the boy
wore freighter plains costume, of broad hat and flannel
shirt and trousers tucked into boots; and he held a
yager in his hand, and had a butcher knife and two big<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
Colt’s revolvers stuck in his belt. He and the two men
looked pretty well tired out, but they stood fast and
answered all kinds of questions.</p>

<p>The mule fort showed how hot had been the battle,
for the mule bodies fairly bristled with arrows.
Arrows were everywhere on the ground about.</p>

<p>The freighters had crowded close, and everybody
was talking and laughing at once. Davy stood unnoted
on the outskirts, gazing and listening—until on
a sudden he was espied by a tall, lank teamster with
long dusty whiskers.</p>

<p>“Hello, thar!” the man called, loudly. “Whar’d
you come from, Red? Lookee, boys! Reckon we’ve
picked up a trav’ler. Whoopee! Come hyar, son.
Give us an account of yoreself.”</p>

<p>One after another, they all looked. Davy flushed
and fidgeted and felt much embarrassed. The tall
whiskered freighter strode forward and grasped him
by the ragged shirt-sleeve.</p>

<p>“What’s yore name?”</p>

<p>“David Scott.”</p>

<p>“Whar’d you come from?”</p>

<p>“The Indians had me. They killed my uncle and
aunt and made me go along.”</p>

<p>“Whar was that?”</p>

<p>“Back on the Overland Trail. We were with a
wagon train and got separated.”</p>

<p>“How long ago?”</p>

<p>“Two weeks, I think.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span></p>

<p>“What Injuns?”</p>

<p>“Those——” and Davy pointed in the direction
taken by the Cut Nose band.</p>

<p>“I want to know!” The teamster gaped wide in
astonishment, and from the crowd came a chorus of
exclamations. “How’d you get away?”</p>

<p>“When you scared them off I hid behind a bush.
Two squaws had me, and they didn’t wait.”</p>

<p>“You mean to say you war with those same pesky
Injuns who war attackin’ this fort hyar?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. But I didn’t do any of the fighting.”</p>

<p>“No, o’ course you didn’t. Wall, I’m jiggered!”
And the whiskered freighter seemed overwhelmed with
amazement. But he rallied, as a thought struck him.
“Come along hyar. I’ll interduce ye to another boy.”
And by the sleeve he led Davy forward, through the
staring crowd. “Hyar, now; I want to interduce ye
to a reg’lar rip-snorter, not much older’n you are.
Red, shake hands with little Billy Cody, the hero of
the mule fort.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="III">III<br />
<small>WITH THE WAGON TRAIN</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Little Billy Cody” was the boy who had been
with the two men in the mule fort. Surrounded by the
staring crowd Davy felt rather timid and did not know
exactly what to do. But Billy Cody promptly put out
his hand, Davy extended his, and Billy gripped it
warmly.</p>

<p>“Hello,” he said, gruffly. “Where do you hail
from?”</p>

<p>“I was out there, with the Indians, while you were
fighting,” explained Davy.</p>

<p>“Didn’t we give it to ’em!” asserted Billy Cody.
“They thought they had us; but they didn’t.”</p>

<p>“I saw you shoot Lame Buffalo,” said Davy,
eagerly. “I guess you killed him.”</p>

<p>“He shore did,” declared the wounded man.
“When little Billy draws bead on anything, it’s a
goner.”</p>

<p>“Well, I had to do it,” said Billy Cody. “Lew told
me to.”</p>

<p>“So I did,” uttered the second of the two men.
“It was time those Injuns knew what they were up<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
against, when they tackled us and Billy. That one shot
licked ’em.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah for little Billy!” cheered the crowd,
good-natured; and Billy fidgeted, embarrassed, although
anybody could see that he was rather proud.</p>

<p>He was a good-looking boy, although now his face
was burned and grimy, and his clothing rough. He
stood a little taller than Davy, but he was slender and
wiry. He had brown hair and dark brown eyes and
regular features; and under his grime and tan his skin
was smooth. He was dressed just like the men, and
carried himself like a man; but the muzzle of the long
heavy yager extended above his hat-brim. Evidently
his two companions thought highly of him, and so did
the men of the wagon train.</p>

<p>“Some of you tend to Woods’ shoulder; then if
you’ll hustle a little grub we’ll be ready for it,” quoth
the man called Lew. “Those mule carcasses served a
good purpose but they weren’t very appetizing.”</p>

<p>“First of all, I want a drink,” announced the man
called Woods.</p>

<p>Prompt hands passed forward canteens, and Billy
and the two men took long, hearty swigs of water.</p>

<p>“Arrow wasn’t pizened, was it?” queried several
voices, of Mr. Woods.</p>

<p>“No. Lew looked at it, and said not. So he put
a hunk o’ tobacco on it, and we haven’t paid much more
attention to it,” answered Mr. Woods. “But it’s powerful
sore.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span></p>

<p>“Here; I’ll fix it up,” proffered a quiet man, who
had not been saying much. Now noticing him, Davy
thought that he was the finest figure in the whole party.
This man was young (he could not have been more
than twenty, but this pioneer life turned youths into
men early) and was splendidly built. He stood a
straight six feet, with slim waist and broad shoulders
and flat back; his hair was long and light yellow, and
his wavy moustache also was light yellow. His eyes
were wide and steel gray, his nose hawk-like, his chin
square and firm. His clothes fitted him well, and were
worn with an easy grace. About his strong neck was
loosely knotted a red silk handkerchief.</p>

<p>“All right, Bill,” responded Mr. Woods, sitting
down. “’Twon’t need much, except a little washing.”</p>

<p>Bill calmly proceeded to inspect the arrow
wound in the shoulder. Other men were hastily producing
food from the wagons.</p>

<p>“Here, Red,” they bade, to Davy; and sitting in
the half circle with Mr. Lew and Billy Cody, Davy
gladly ate. It seemed good to be with white people
again.</p>

<p>“How long did the Injuns have you?” asked Billy.</p>

<p>“About two weeks.”</p>

<p>“They were Cheyennes, weren’t they. Who was
their chief?”</p>

<p>“Cut Nose. He was head chief. But Lame Buffalo
and Bear-Who-Walks were chiefs, too.”</p>

<p>“That Cut Nose is a mean Injun,” pronounced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
Billy, wagging his big hat. “But he didn’t catch <em>us</em>—not
with Lew Simpson bossing our job. I thought we
were wiped out, sure, till Lew told us to kill our mules
quick and get behind ’em. That was a great scheme.”</p>

<p>“It shore was,” agreed all the men around, wagging
their heads, too, while they listened. “Injuns
hate to charge folks they can’t see well.”</p>

<p>“Weren’t you afraid?” asked Davy. He liked
this Billy Cody, who acted so like a man and yet was
only a boy.</p>

<p>“He afraid? Billy Cody afraid?” laughed the
listeners. “You don’t know Billy yet.”</p>

<p>“Whether or not we were afraid, we were mighty
glad to have those mules in front of us, weren’t we,
Billy?” spoke up Lew Simpson. “They made a heap
of difference.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” answered Billy, frankly. And
everybody laughed again.</p>

<p>The meal was quickly finished. It consisted of only
cold beans and chunks of dried beef, but it tasted tremendously
good to Davy; and he didn’t see that Billy
or Mr. Simpson slighted their share, either. Mr.
Woods had been eating while his wound was being
dressed.</p>

<p>“George, you’d better ride in a wagon for a day or
so,” called Mr. Simpson, rising, to Mr. Woods.
“Well, Red,” and he addressed Davy, “I reckon you’ll
travel along with us. We’re bound back to the States.
Got any folks there?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span></p>

<p>“No, sir,” said Davy, with a lump in his throat.
“But I’d like to go on with you.”</p>

<p>“All right-o. Now, some of you fellows hustle us
a mule apiece, while Billy and I plunder those Injuns
out there. Then we’ll travel.”</p>

<p>Mr. Simpson spoke like one in authority. Billy
Cody promptly sprang up, and he and Mr. Simpson
strode out into the plain, where the dead Indians and
the ponies were lying. Lame Buffalo was the farthest
of all; but he was still, like the rest. Evidently he
would ride and fight no more.</p>

<p>The wagon train men bustled about, reforming for
the march. Three mules were saddled, as mounts for
Davy and the two others. Having passed rapidly over
the field, Mr. Simpson and Billy returned, laden with
the weapons and ornaments of the warriors and the
trappings of the ponies. They made two trips. Davy
recognized the shield and head-dress of Lame Buffalo,
who would need them not again. Billy proudly carried
them and stowed them in a wagon.</p>

<p>“Those are yours, aren’t they?” asked Davy, following
him, to watch.</p>

<p>“They’re mine if I want them,” said Billy.
“Reckon I’ll take ’em home and give ’em to my
sisters.”</p>

<p>“Where do you live?”</p>

<p>“In Salt Creek Valley, Eastern Kansas, near
Leavenworth. Where do you?”</p>

<p>“Nowhere, I guess,” replied Davy, trying to smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span></p>

<p>“Pshaw!” sympathized Billy. “That’s sure hard
luck. Ride along with me and I’ll tell you about
things.”</p>

<p>“Here, boy—crawl into this,” called a teamster
nearby; and he tossed at Davy a red flannel shirt.
“It’ll match yore ha’r.” And he laughed good-naturedly.</p>

<p>“It’s my color all right,” responded Davy, without
being teased, as he picked up the shirt. “Much
obliged.” He slipped it over his head. It fitted more
like a blouse than a shirt, but he needed something of
the kind. After he had turned back the sleeves and
tucked in the long tails, he was very comfortable.</p>

<p>“Climb on your mule, Red,” bade Billy Cody.
“We’re going to start, and Lew Simpson won’t wait
for anybody.”</p>

<p>Mr. Simpson was already on his mule. The other
mounted men were in their saddles. Mr. Simpson cast
a keen glance adown the line.</p>

<p>“All ready?” he shouted. “Go ahead.”</p>

<p>The long lash of the leading teamster shot out with
a resounding crack.</p>

<p>“Gee-up!” he cried. “You Buck! Spot!” And
again his whip cracked smartly. His six yoke of oxen
leaned to their work; the wagon creaked as it moved.
All down the line other whips were cracking, and other
teamsters were shouting, and the wagons creaked and
groaned. One after another they started, until the
whole train was in motion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Simpson and two or three companions led,
keeping to the advance. The other riders were scattered
in bunches back on either side of the train; the
teamsters walked beside their wagons; and in the rear
of the train ambled a large bunch of loose cattle and
mules, driven by a herder.</p>

<p>Billy Cody and Dave rode together, well up toward
the front.</p>

<p>“Did you ever freight any?” queried Billy.
“What was that train you were with? Just emigrants?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Davy. “We were going to Salt
Lake.”</p>

<p>“Mormons?” demanded Billy, quickly.</p>

<p>“No. After we’d got to Salt Lake maybe we’d
have gone on to California.”</p>

<p>“Expect I’ll go across to California sometime,”
asserted Billy. “How old are you, Red?”</p>

<p>“Eleven.”</p>

<p>“I’m thirteen, but I’ve been drawing pay with a bull
train three trips out and back. The first time I was
herder from Fort Leavenworth out to Fort Kearney
and back. Next time I was herder from Leavenworth
for Salt Lake, but the Injuns turned us at Plum Creek
just beyond Fort Kearney and we had to quit. I killed
an Injun too dead to skin, but I was so scared I didn’t
know what I was doing. Last summer I went out as
extra hand with a big outfit for the soldiers at Salt
Lake, but the Mormons held us up and took all our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
stuff, so we couldn’t help the army, and we had to
spend the winter at Fort Bridger, and all of us nearly
starved.”</p>

<p>“What’s an extra hand?” asked Davy.</p>

<p>“He takes the place of any other man, who may be
sick or hurt,” explained Billy, importantly. “I’m
drawing man’s pay; forty a month. I’m saving it to
give to my mother, as soon as I get back. Weren’t you
ever with a bull train before?”</p>

<p>Davy shook his head.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“This is a Russell, Majors &amp; Waddell outfit,” proceeded
Billy. “They’re the big freighters out of
Leavenworth across the plains and down to Santa Fe.
Gee, they haul a lot of stuff! We’re travelling empty,
back from Fort Laramie to Leavenworth. This is only
half the train; there’s another section on ahead of us.
Lew and George and I were riding on to catch up
with it, when those Injuns corralled us. If Lew hadn’t
been so smart, they’d have had our hair, too. We
wouldn’t have stood any show at all. But those mules
did the business. And I had a dream that helped. Last
night I dreamed my old dog Turk came and woke me;
and when I did wake I saw the Injuns sneaking up on
us. Then we all woke, and drove ’em back. I’m going
to thank Turk for that. I don’t know how he found
me. This isn’t the regular trail; but Lew thought he’d
make a short cut.”</p>

<p>“Is he the captain?” asked Davy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span></p>

<p>“He’s wagon boss; he’s boss of the whole train,
and he’s a dandy. I reckon he’s the best wagon boss on
the plains. George Woods—the man who was
wounded—he’s assistant boss. He’s plucky, I tell you.
That arrow didn’t phase him at all. Lew bound a big
chunk of tobacco on it, and George went on fighting.
Do you know what they call this outfit. It’s a bull
outfit, and those drivers are bull-whackers. Jiminy,
but they can throw those whips some!”</p>

<p>“When will we get to Leavenworth, do you
think?”</p>

<p>“In about twenty-five days. We’re travelling
light, and I guess we can make twenty miles a day.
We’ve got a lot of government men with us, from
Fort Laramie, and the Injuns will think twice before
they interfere, you bet. We’re too many for ’em. I
reckon those Cheyennes didn’t expect to see another
bull train following that first one.”</p>

<p>“No. They thought you were left behind and were
trying to catch up. So they waited to starve you out.
That’s what fooled ’em.”</p>

<p>“It sure did,” nodded Billy, gravely. “Say,
there’s another fine man with this outfit. He’s the one
who dressed Woods’ shoulder. His name’s Jim
Hickok, but everybody calls him ‘Wild Bill.’ Isn’t
he a good-looker?”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Davy.</p>

<p>“Well, he isn’t just looks, either,” asserted Billy.
“He’s all there. He’s been a mighty good friend of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
mine. Because I was a boy some of the men thought
they could impose on me. A big fellow slapped me
off a bull-yoke, when I was sitting and didn’t jump
the instant he bade me. I was so mad I threw a pot
of hot coffee in his face; and I reckon he’d have
killed me if Wild Bill hadn’t knocked him cold. When
he came to he wanted to fight; but Wild Bill told him
if he or anybody else ever bullied ‘little Billy’
(that’s what they call me) they’d get such a pounding
that they wouldn’t be well for a month of Sundays.
Nobody wants trouble with Wild Bill. He can handle
any man in the outfit; but he doesn’t fight unless he has
to. He’s quiet, and means to mind his own business.”</p>

<p>With the wagons creaking and groaning, and the
oxen puffing and wheezing, and the teamsters cracking
their long whips, the bull train slowly toiled on,
across the rolling prairie. The trail taken occasionally
approached the banks of the North Platte River, and
soon there would be reached the place where the
North Platte and the South Platte joined, to make the
main Platte, flowing southeastward for the Missouri,
400 miles distant. Beyond the Missouri were the
States, lined up against this “Indian country” where
all the freighting and emigrating was going on.</p>

<p>The train made a halt at noon, and again at evening.
Nothing especial had occurred since the rescue
of the three in the mule fort. Davy was very glad,
at night, to lie down with Billy Cody under a blanket,
among friends, instead of shivering in an Indian camp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span></p>

<p>Start was made again at sunrise. To-day the main
travelled Platte Trail would be reached, and the going
would be easier. Just as the trails joined in mid-morning,
a sudden cry sped down the long line of
wagons.</p>

<p>“Buffalo! Buffalo!”</p>

<p>All was excitement. Davy peered.</p>

<p>“See ’em?” said Billy, pointing. “That’s a big
herd. Thousands of ’em. Hurray for fresh meat.”</p>

<p>Ahead, between the river at one side and some sand
bluffs at the other, a black mass, of groups as thick as
gooseberry bushes, had appeared. The mass was in
slow motion, as the groups grazed hither and thither.
On the edges, black dots told of buffaloes feeding out
from the main body. There must have been thousands
of the buffalo. Davy had seen other herds but none
so large as this one. His blood tingled—especially
when Lew Simpson, the wagon boss came galloping
back.</p>

<p>“Ride on, some of you men,” he shouted. “There’s
meat. You whackers follow along by the trail and be
on hand when we’re butchering.”</p>

<p>“I can’t go, can I?” appealed Davy, eagerly, to
Billy.</p>

<p>“No; you haven’t any gun,” answered Billy.
“I’m going, though. I can kill as many buffalo as
anybody. You watch us.”</p>

<p>Forward galloped Lew Simpson and Billy and
twenty others. From a wagon George Woods, his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
shoulder bandaged and painful, stuck out his head, and
lamented the fact that he was too sore to ride. The
buffalo hunt promised to be great sport; and, besides,
the fresh meat would be a welcome change.</p>

<p>So away the hunters galloped, Lew Simpson and
little Billy leading. The train, guarded by the other
men, followed, closely watching. Even the very rear
of it was excited.</p>

<p>Now arose another cry, passing from mouth to
mouth.</p>

<p>“Lookee there! More hunters!”</p>

<p>That was so. Beyond the buffalo, up along the
river were speeding another squad of horsemen, evidently
intent upon the same prey. They were coursing
rapidly, but already the buffalo had seen them, and
with uplifted heads the farthest animals were gazing,
alarmed.</p>

<p>“Our fellows will have to hurry,” remarked the
teamster nearest to Davy. “Shucks! That’s no way
to hunt buff’ler. Those fellers must be crazy. They’ll
stampede the whole herd!”</p>

<p>“They’ll stampede the whole herd, sure,” agreed
everybody.</p>

<p>It was a moment of great interest. Davy thumped
his mule with his heels, and hastened ahead, the better
to witness. The party led by Lew Simpson and Wild
Bill and little Billy had been making a circuit, keeping
to the cover of the low ground, until they were close
enough to charge; but those other hunters were riding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
boldly, as if to run the buffalo down. And as anybody
should know, this really was not the right way to hunt
buffalo.</p>

<p>“They’ll drive ’em into our fellows,” claimed several
voices. “They’ll do the runnin’ an’ we’ll do the
killin’!”</p>

<p>“Or else they’ll drive ’em into <em>us</em>!” cried others.
“Watch out, boys! Watch yore teams! Steady with
yore teams, or there’ll be the dickens to pay.”</p>

<p>That seemed likely. The stranger hunters were
right upon the herd; the outside buffalo had wheeled;
and tossing their heads and whirling, now with heads
low and tails high the whole great herd was being set
in motion, fleeing to escape. The thudding of their
hoofs drifted like rolling thunder. After the herd
pelted the stranger hunters.</p>

<p>Part of the herd plashed through the river; part
made for the sand-hills—but smelling or sighting the
Simpson party, they veered and came on, between the
river and the sand-hills, straight for the trail and the
wagon-train. In vain out dashed, to turn them, the
Simpson party; from the train itself the horsemen
spurred forward, as a bulwark of defense; the teamsters
shouted and “Gee-hawed” and swung their bull-whips,
and the oxen, surging and swerving, their
nostrils wide and their eyes bulging, dragged the
wagons in confusion. In his excitement Davy rode
on, into the advance, to help it.</p>

<p>To shout and wave at those crazy hunters and order<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
them to quit their pursuit was useless. They didn’t
see and they couldn’t hear; at least, they did not seem
to understand. Panic-stricken, the buffaloes came
straight on. Off to the side Lew Simpson and Wild Bill
and little Billy and companions were shooting rapidly;
the stranger hunters were shooting, behind; and
now the reinforcements from the train were shooting
and yelling, hoping to split the herd. Some of the
buffaloes staggered and fell; others never hesitated or
turned, but forged along as if blind and deaf. One
enormous old bull seemed to bear a charmed life; he
galloped right through the skirmish line; and the next
thing that Davy, as excited as anybody, knew, the bull
sighted him, and charged him.</p>

<p>Davy found himself apparently all alone with the
big bull. He did not need to turn his mule; his mule
turned of its own accord, and away they raced. Davy
was vaguely conscious of shouts and shots and the
frenzied leaps of his frightened mule, which was
heading back to the wagon train. Davy did not know
that he was doing right, to lead the angry bull into
the train; he tugged in vain at his mule’s bit, and
could not make the slightest impression. Then, down
pitched the mule, as if he had thrust his foot into a
hole; and the ground flew up and struck Davy on the
ear. In a long slide he went scraping on ear and shoulder,
before he could stagger to his feet.</p>

<p>The mule was galloping away; but Davy looked for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
the buffalo. The big bull had stopped short and was
staring and rumbling, as if astonished. The change
in the shape of the thing that he had been chasing
seemed to make him angrier. He stood, puzzled and
staring and rumbling, only about twenty yards from
Davy. Suddenly the red shirt must have got into his
eyes, for his fore-hoofs began to throw the dirt higher,
and Davy somehow knew that he was going to charge.</p>

<p>Not much time had passed; no, not a quarter of a
minute, since the mule had fallen and had left Davy
to the buffalo. The wagon train men were yelling and
running, from the one direction; the hunters were yelling
and riding, from the other; and whether they were
yelling and hurrying on his account, Davy could not
look, to see. Down had dropped the bull’s huge shaggy
head, up had flirted his little knobbed tail; and on he
came.</p>

<p>Davy never knew how he managed—he dimly
heard another outburst of confused shouts, amidst
which Billy Cody’s voice rang the clearest, with
“Dodge him, Red! This way, this way!” He did not
dare to glance aside, and he felt that it was not much
use to run; but in a twinkling he peeled off the crimson
shirt (which was so large for him) and throwing it,
sprang aside.</p>

<p>Into the shirt plunged the big bull, and tossed it
and rammed it and trampled it, while Davy watched
amazed, ready to run off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span></p>

<p>“Bully for you, Red!” sang out a familiar voice;
riding hard to Davy’s side dashed Billy Cody, on
lathered mule; he levelled his yager, it spoke, the big
bull started and stiffened, as if stung. Slowly he
swayed and yielded, with a series of grunts sinking
down, and down; from his knees he rolled to his side;
and there he lay, not breathing.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="IV">IV<br />
<small>VISITING BILLY CODY</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“All right, Red,” panted Billy Cody. “He’s
spoiled your shirt, though. Lucky you weren’t inside
it. Say, that was a smart trick you did. Get up behind
me. The wagon train’s in a heap of trouble.
Let’s go over there.”</p>

<p>Davy’s knees were shaking and he could not speak;
he was ashamed to seem so frightened, but he clambered
aboard the mule, behind the saddle. Away Billy
spurred for the wagon train. Other hunters were
spurring in the same direction.</p>

<p>The wagon train certainly was having a time of it.
Those stranger hunters, from down the river, had
driven the buffaloes straight into the teams. The cavvy
of loose cattle and mules had scattered; ox-teams had
broken their yokes or had stampeded with the wagons.
Several wagons were over-turned; and a big buffalo
was galloping away with an ox-yoke entangled in his
horns. Wild Bill overhauled him in short order and
returned with the yoke; but hither and thither across
the field were racing and chasing other men, ahorse
and afoot, trying to gather the train together again.</p>

<p>By the time that the buffalo charge had passed on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
through and the animals were making off into the distance,
most of the train’s hunters had arrived. The
other hunters, from below, also arrived. They proved
to be a party of emigrants, for California, who did not
understand how to hunt buffalo. In fact, they had not
killed a single one. However, Lew Simpson gave
them a pretty dressing down for their carelessness.</p>

<p>“You’ve held us up for a day, at least,” he
stormed; “and you’ve done us several hundred dollars’
worth of damage besides.”</p>

<p>“Well-nigh killed that boy, too,” spoke somebody.
“Did you see him peel that shirt? Haw-haw!
Slipped out of it quicker’n a snake goin’ through a
holler log!”</p>

<p>“Little Billy came a-runnin’, though,” reminded
somebody else.</p>

<p>“Yep; but didn’t save the shirt!”</p>

<p>That was true—everybody agreed that Davy would
not have been saved had he not acted promptly. He
was given another shirt (a blue one) to take the place of
the one sacrificed to the big buffalo.</p>

<p>The California party rode away, taking a little
meat that Lew Simpson offered them after they had
properly apologized for their clumsiness. The rest of
the day was spent in cutting up the buffaloes, and in
repairing the wagons and harness. Not until the next
noon was the train able to resume its creaking way,
down the Platte River trail, for the Missouri River
at Fort Leavenworth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span></p>

<p>About twenty miles a day were covered now, regularly,
and during the days Davy learned considerable
about a “bull train” on the plains. He learned that
he was lucky to ride instead of walk; nearly everybody
with a bull train walked. However, this train was
travelling almost empty, back from Fort Laramie, on
the North Platte River in western Nebraska (for
Nebraska Territory extended to the middle of present
Wyoming), to Fort Leavenworth in eastern Kansas
Territory. It was accompanied by a lot of government
employes, who did not work for the train, and these
rode if they could furnish their own mules. Lew
Simpson, the wagon boss, and George Woods, the assistant
wagon boss, Billy the extra hand, and the herder,
rode, because that was the custom; all the other employes
walked.</p>

<p>The oxen or “bulls” (as they were called) were
guided by voice and whip. The whip, though, rarely
touched them hard; just a flick of the lash at one side
or the other of the leading span was enough. A
sharp “Gee up!” or a “Whoa, haw, Buck!” and a
motion of the lash, did the business. Some of the
oxen seemed to be very wise.</p>

<p>“Do you know what those whips are, Red?” asked
Billy.</p>

<p>“Raw hide.”</p>

<p>“Better than that. I’ll get one and show you when
we camp.”</p>

<p>So he did that noon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span></p>

<p>“Hickory stock, and lash of buffalo hide, tanned,
with a buck-skin cracker,” informed Billy. “Eighteen
inch stock, eighteen foot lash, and cost eighteen dollars.
You ought to see some of these whackers sling
a whip! They can stand at the fore wheel and pick a
fly off the lead team! Yes, and they can take a chunk
of hide out, too—but they don’t often do that.”</p>

<p>Davy curiously examined the bull whip. The stock
was short and smooth, the lash was long and braided
thickest in the middle, like the shape of a snake. The
cracker was about six inches in length, and already had
frayed at the tip; and no wonder, for it had often been
made to snap like a pistol shot!</p>

<p>“I can swing the thing a little, but it’s sort of long
for me,” announced Billy, proceeding to practise with
it, until he had almost taken off his own ear, and made
the whole mess uneasy. “I’m not going to quit,
though,” he added, “until I can throw a bull whip as
good as anybody;” and he took the whip back to its
owner.</p>

<p>Billy was quite a privileged character, at camp and
on the march. Everybody liked him, and considered
him about as good as a man. To be an “extra hand”
was no small job. It meant that whenever any of the
teamsters was sick or hurt or otherwise laid off, “little
Billy” took his place. The “extra hand” rode with
the wagon boss (who was Lew Simpson), carried orders
for him down the line, and was held ready to fill<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
a vacancy. So this duty required a boy of no ordinary
pluck and sense.</p>

<p>Besides, it was generally known that Billy was
drawing wages to give to his mother, who was a widow
trying to raise a family. Billy was the “man” of the
family, and they depended on him. The wagon train
liked him all the more for this. Everybody spoke well
of “little Billy,” for his good sense and his courage.
Davy heard many stories of what he had done. The
fight in the mule fort had showed his quality in danger;
and he had proved himself in several other “scrimmages”
with the Indians.</p>

<p>He and Davy and Lew Simpson and George
Woods and Wild Bill and a squad of government men
formed a mess, which ate together. The pleasantest
part of the day was the noon halt, around the camp-fire;
and the evening camp, at sunset. Billy put in
part of his rests at practising writing with charcoal on
any surface that he could find. Even when Davy had
joined the train, the wagon boxes and tongues and
wheels bore scrawls such as “Little Billy Cody,”
“Billy Cody the Boy Scout,” “William Frederick
Cody,” etc. However, as a writer Dave could beat
Billy “a mile,” as the teamsters said. Billy was not
much of a figurer, either. But he was bound to learn.</p>

<p>“Ma wants me to go to school some more,” he
admitted. “So I suppose I’ll have to this winter. I
went some last winter, and we had a teacher in the
house, too. A little schooling won’t hurt a fellow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span></p>

<p>“No, I suppose it won’t,” answered Davy, gravely.
“I’ve had to go to school. But I’d rather do this.”</p>

<p>“So would I,” confessed Billy. “I like it and I
need the money—and I need the schooling, too.
Reckon I can do both.”</p>

<p>As for Davy himself, the wagon train seemed to
consider him, also, somewhat of a personage, because
he had shown his “smartness” when the buffalo bull
had attacked him. Of course, he had only slid out of
his big flannel shirt, and fooled the buffalo with it;
but that had been the right thing done in the right
place at the right time, and this counted.</p>

<p>Nothing especial happened as the long train toiled
on. The trail was fine, worn smooth by many years of
travel over it. This was the old Oregon Trail, and
California, from the Missouri River, over the plains
and the mountains, clear to the Pacific coast of the
West. Beaver trappers and Indian traders had opened
it, thirty years ago, and it had been used ever since,
by trappers and traders, and by soldiers and emigrants,
and its name was known the world around.</p>

<p>The wagon train frequently met other outfits,
freight and emigrants, bound west; and before the
train turned off the main trail for the government road
branching southeast for Leavenworth, the Hockaday
&amp; Liggett stage-coach from St. Joseph on the Missouri
for Salt Lake City passed them. It wasn’t much of a
stage, being only a small wagon covered with canvas
and drawn by four mules, and running twice a month;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
but it carried passengers clear through from the Missouri
River to Utah. The wagon train gave it a cheer
as it trundled by.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do when you reach Leavenworth,
Red?” asked Billy one day, when they were
riding along. Leavenworth was now only a few days
ahead.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” answered Davy. “I guess I can
find a job somewhere. I’ll work for my board.”</p>

<p>“Oh, pshaw! I’ll get you a job with a bull train,”
spoke Billy confidently. “I’ll ask Mr. Russell or Mr.
Majors. They’ll take care of any friend of mine, and
you’ve proved you’re the right stuff. But first you
come home with me. I’ll give you a good time. Wild
Bill’s coming, too, after a while.”</p>

<p>“Maybe your folks won’t want me.”</p>

<p>This made Billy almost mad.</p>

<p>“They will, too. What do you talk that way for?
You ought to see my mother. I’ve got the best mother
that ever lived. She’ll be glad to see anybody that I
bring home, and so will my sisters, and Turk. You
come along. The trail goes right past the place, and
we’ll quit there, and not wait to reach Leavenworth.
I’ll get paid off first.”</p>

<p>There was no resisting Billy, and Davy promised.</p>

<p>Yes, evidently Leavenworth and the end of that
long Overland Trail were near. The talk in the train
was largely of Fort Leavenworth and Leavenworth
City, where the train would be broken and reorganized<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
for another trip, and the men would have a short rest
and see the sights, if they chose. New farms were
being passed, and the beginnings of new settlements;
and the number of emigrant outfits was much increased.
The greetings all referred to the farther
West—Kansas, Utah, and California were on every
tongue. Over the trail hung a constant dust of travel,
and the air was vibrant with the spirit of pioneers
pushing their way into a new country. These men,
women and children, travelling with team and wagon,
were brave people. Nothing, not even the Indians,
was keeping them back. They intended to settle somewhere
and establish homes again. The sight sometimes
made Davy sick at heart, because he, too, had
been travelling with one of these household wagons;
but the Indians had “wiped it out.”</p>

<p>Well, he was in good hands now. Billy Cody
would see him through.</p>

<p>“We’ll strike the Salt Creek Valley to-morrow
morning,” announced Billy. “Hurrah! I’ll get my
pay order to-night, so we can cut away to-morrow
without any waiting.”</p>

<p>The morning was yet young when Billy pointed
ahead.</p>

<p>“When we get over this hill we’ll see where I live,
Red. It’s yonder, on the other side.”</p>

<p>The trail was ascending a long hill. From the top
Billy waved his hat.</p>

<p>“There’s the Salt Creek Valley. I can see the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
house, too. That’s it, down below. Goodby, everybody.
Come on, Red.” And with a whoop away raced
Billy down the hill.</p>

<p>As he rode he whistled shrill.</p>

<p>“Watch for Turk,” he cried to Red, galloping behind.
And presently he cried again: “There he comes!
I knew he would!”</p>

<p>Sure enough, from the house, before and below,
near the trail, out had darted a dog, to stand a moment,
listening and peering—then, head up and ears
pricked, to line himself at full speed for Billy. On he
scoured (what a big fellow he was when he drew
near), while Billy whistled and shouted and laughed
and praised.</p>

<p>When they met, Billy flung himself from his saddle
for a moment, and he and the big dog wrestled in sheer
delight.</p>

<p>“Isn’t he a dandy?” called Billy to Red. “Smartest
old fellow in Kansas. He saved my sisters’ lives
once from a panther. I’d rather have him than a man
any time.”</p>

<p>They rode on, with Turk gambolling beside them.
He was a brindled boar hound, looking like a Great
Dane.</p>

<p>Now Turk raced ahead, as if to carry the news;
and several people had emerged from the house and
were gathered before the door gazing. Billy waved
his big hat, and they waved back. They were a woman
and four girls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span></p>

<p>“That’s ma and my sisters,” said Billy. Down he
rushed, at full gallop of his mule; Davy thudded in his
wake.</p>

<p>“Hello, mother! Hello, sisses!”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s Will! Will!”</p>

<p>Dismounting, Billy was passed from one to another
and hugged and kissed. He was held the longest and
closest in his mother’s arms. Turk barked and barked.</p>

<p>“Here, Red; come on,” ordered Billy, of Dave.
“Mother, this is my friend Dave Scott. He’s going
to visit us, and then I’ll get him a job on the trail.
These girls are my sisters, Dave. Don’t be afraid of
them. Take care of him, Turk. He’s all right, old
fellow. He’s a partner.” And Turk, sniffing of Davy
and wagging his great tail, seemed to understand.</p>

<p>“Any friend of Will’s is more than welcome,”
said Billy’s mother, and she actually kissed Dave. The
girls shyly shook hands, and he knew that they welcomed
him, too.</p>

<p>Then they all went into the house, where Billy
must sit down and tell about his experiences. That
took some time, for he had been gone a year. But before
he started to talk and answer questions, he said:
“Here, ma; here’s my pay check. How do you want
it cashed—gold or silver?”</p>

<p>“For goodness sake, Will!” gasped Mother Cody,
while his sisters peeped. “Is this all yours?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Billy, solemnly shaking his head. “I
can’t say it is, mother.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span></p>

<p>“Then whose is it?” she asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“Yours,” laughed Billy.</p>

<p>The Cody house was a heavy log cabin of two
rooms and a rough roof, in the Salt River Valley across
which ran the Salt Lake overland trail. Fort Leavenworth
and the Missouri River were only four miles
eastward, and two miles below Fort Leavenworth was
Leavenworth City. The Cody farm had been located
by Billy’s father as soon as Kansas had been opened
for settlement, in 1853, but Billy’s father had died two
years ago. As Davy soon saw, Billy was the man of
the family, and whatever he earned was badly needed.</p>

<p>It was good fun visiting at the Codys. There was
Mrs. Cody and the four girls, Julia, Eliza, Helen and
May, who seemed to think that Billy knew everything.
Julia was older than he, but the others were younger.
There was Turk the big dog; and not far from the
Cody place lived other settlers who had children. But
among all the boys Billy Cody was the only one who
had been out across the plains drawing man’s pay with
a wagon train.</p>

<p>The Codys lived right at the edge of the Kickapoo
Indian reservation. Billy knew the Indians and they
liked him; he could shoot with bow and arrow, and
could talk Kickapoo, and had learned a lot of clever
ways to camp and travel.</p>

<p>Best of all, past the Cody place, across Salt Creek
Valley wended the Overland Trail—climbing the hill
here, and disappearing into the west. Over it always<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
hung that veil of dust from the teams and wagons that
had set out. All kinds of “outfits,” as Billy called
them, travelled it: the straining, creaking “bull trains,”
carrying freight for the big freighting firm of Russell,
Majors &amp; Waddell; the settlers, bound westward, with
their canvas-topped wagons bursting with household
goods, the women and children often walking alongside;
soldiers, for the forts of the Indian country; gold-seekers
with pack mules; “tame” Indians, from the
reservations or from outside villages; parties returning
for the “States,” from California and Utah and
the mountains, some of them with droves of horses,
some without anything at all.</p>

<p>It was a very important highway, this Salt Lake,
California and Oregon “Overland” Trail, which had
one beginning at Leavenworth on the Missouri, only
six miles from the Cody place; and the Codys saw all
the travel that started on it. So no wonder Billy had
made up his mind to be a plainsman and work on the
trail; and no wonder that Davy wanted to do likewise.
It seemed a useful work, and much needed; but
it called for stout mind and brave heart, as well as
sturdy body. As for sturdy body the work itself made
people strong. The proper mind and heart were the
more necessary qualifications.</p>

<p>Billy soon took the two mules into Leavenworth,
and returned them to the company. When he came
home, he gave his mother a double handful of gold
pieces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span></p>

<p>“Will, it doesn’t seem possible that you’ve earned
all this!”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess if you’d been along, ma, you’d have
known that I earned them; wouldn’t she, Dave!”
laughed Billy. “I earned enough just while I was in
the mule fort to keep us the rest of our lives—only,
I haven’t got it yet.”</p>

<p>“You’ll never go out again, will you, Will?” appealed
his mother anxiously. “Promise me.”</p>

<p>Billy put his arms about her and hugged her tight.
She was a frail little mother, not nearly as strong as
Billy, and she never felt well, Billy had explained to
Dave. Now he said, holding her:</p>

<p>“I can’t promise, ma. We need the money, and
that’s the quickest way to earn it. But I always come
back safe, don’t I? Don’t you ever worry about <em>me</em>.
I can take care of myself. I’m as good as a man, you
know.”</p>

<p>Mother Cody only sighed, and kissed him. She
said nothing more.</p>

<small>DAVY GOES ON HERD</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Red,” said Billy, after three weeks had passed,
“what do you want to do? I’m going out again.”</p>

<p>“Where, Billy?” asked Dave.</p>

<p>“Out across the plains. Got another job with a
bull train. I can’t stand this loafing. You can stay
here, I reckon. My mother’ll be glad to have you.
Or I’ll get you a job with the company.”</p>

<p>Of course, Davy had no notion of staying on at the
Cody home, where means were scant and where Mrs.
Cody, helped by Billy, had all she could do to take
care of her own children. No; he wanted to earn his
way in the world.</p>

<p>“I think I’d rather go to work,” he answered.
“When will you start, Billy?”</p>

<p>“Next week. Come on into town. We’ll see Mr.
Russell. He’ll fix you out.”</p>

<p>“Maybe I’m too small.”</p>

<p>“No, you aren’t. Size isn’t what counts, out here.
It’s what a fellow does, not how he looks. See?”</p>

<p>This sounded encouraging, for Billy seemed to
know. Hadn’t he gone to work himself herding cattle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
for the Russell, Majors &amp; Waddell Freighting Company,
when he was aged only ten? And now at
thirteen he was almost the same as a man! Davy determined
to show his own pluck, and do his best, and
make himself a place as a worker in those busy days
when the great West was being settled.</p>

<p>That noon Billy borrowed a couple of ponies from
a neighbor, and he and Dave rode in to Leavenworth
City.</p>

<p>“That Mr. Russell is the finest man you ever met,”
declared Billy. “Mr. Majors is a good one, too, but
Mr. Russell is the one who’s taken special care of me.
He was a mighty close friend of my father’s; when dad
was selling hay to Fort Leavenworth Mr. Russell let
me ride about the country with him and I learned a lot
about the freighting business. Times looked kind of
hard and somebody stole my pony, and he told me to
keep a stiff upper lip and come to Leavenworth and
he’d give me a job herding at twenty-five a month.
That was four years ago. I’ve been working for the
company ever since, except when I had to go to school.
When I started in, it was just Russell &amp; Majors—William
H. Russell and Alexander Majors; last spring
Mr. William Waddell joined them, and now the company
is Russell, Majors &amp; Waddell. Mr. Majors has
been freighting ever since eighteen forty-eight, on the
Santa Fe Trail down into New Mexico. Now the
company hauls all the government stuff from Fort
Leavenworth across the plains to Fort Laramie and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
over to Salt Lake. That train I went out with last
summer carried nearly two hundred thousand pounds
of freight. They’re running about three thousand
wagons now, and use four thousand men. They’re a
big company, but they treat their men right; and whatever
Mr. Russell or Mr. Majors offers you, you take.
If we don’t find either of them at the fort they’ll be in
town, I reckon.”</p>

<p>Fort Leavenworth was located on the high land,
overlooking the Missouri River, two miles above
Leavenworth City. It was an important, solid fort,
with stone buildings grouped about a large parade
ground, and the flag floating in the breeze. Soldiers
of the infantry, cavalry, and dragoons were moving
hither-thither, drilling or attending to other duties,
and on the outskirts of the post were parked a great
number of freight wagons, attended by their teamsters.</p>

<p>As he and Davy rode through the wagons, on either
side of the trail, Billy called out to one of the men.</p>

<p>“Hello, Buck.”</p>

<p>“Hello, Billy.”</p>

<p>“Is Mr. Russell around here?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He’s over at the quartermaster’s office.”</p>

<p>“When do you pull out, Buck?”</p>

<p>“Thursday the tenth, Billy.”</p>

<p>“All right. I’ll be on hand.”</p>

<p>“That’s Buck Bomer,” explained Billy, as he and
Davy rode on. “He’s the wagon boss I’m going out
with. Now we’ll find Mr. Russell.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span></p>

<p>They had no difficulty in passing the guard stationed
beside the road where it entered the edge of
the post. Billy seemed to be a familiar figure here. He
led the way to a large building that looked like a warehouse,
where several freight wagons were standing and
where soldiers and civilians were trudging about, as
if loading freight.</p>

<p>At the end of the platform Billy slipped off his
horse, and tied him; Dave did likewise.</p>

<p>“Come on,” bade Billy. “There’s Mr. Russell
now. That sandy little man talking with the officer.
We’ll hail him when we get the chance.”</p>

<p>They lingered a few minutes, while Billy edged
closer, waiting to be recognized. Davy followed him
about anxiously. Presently Mr. Russell caught sight
of Billy, and smiled and nodded. The officer turned
away, and Billy sprang forward to seize the opportunity.</p>

<p>“How are you, Billy,” greeted Mr. Russell.
“What can I do for you?”</p>

<p>“I’ve brought my friend Dave Scott over, Mr.
Russell,” informed Billy. “He’s the boy I spoke
about. He’d like a job, if you can give it to him.”</p>

<p>Mr. Russell eyed Dave up and down. A small man
was Mr. Russell. He had a freckled complexion, a
rather dried-up appearance, and an abrupt manner; and
he was as keen as tacks. He did not seem to be a man
who could handle rough teamsters; but evidently he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
could. Davy tried to stand his gaze, and not to be
embarrassed.</p>

<p>“What can you do?”</p>

<p>“He’ll tackle anything.”</p>

<p>“He’s the boy who left his shirt to the buffalo, is
he?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. We all liked him with the wagons.”</p>

<p>“Well, I can’t send him out this time. We don’t
need him with a train.” Mr. Russell spoke directly to
Davy. “Did you ever herd?”</p>

<p>“Not much, sir. But I think I could.”</p>

<p>“Well, you go on down to Leavenworth and see
Mr. Majors. He’s hiring the herding end of the business.
If he wants to take you on, all right.” And Mr.
Russell turned away. He was a man of short speech.</p>

<p>“Much obliged, Mr. Russell,” answered the two
boys.</p>

<p>“Come on, Dave,” bade Billy, making for the two
ponies.</p>

<p>They mounted, to go on to Leavenworth City.
This was in plain sight from the high land where the
fort was located. It was nestled prettily in a wooded
basin beside the river two miles southeast. Fort
Leavenworth was on the trail between it and Salt
Creek Valley, and the trail continued to the Missouri
at the town itself.</p>

<p>A lively place Leavenworth proved to be. It contained
about five thousand people, living there, and a
lot more who were simply pausing until they had outfitted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
for the trail westward. The streets were
crowded with teams and wagons and people; and the
river was dotted with rowboats, barges and several
steamboats.</p>

<p>Billy Cody hustled right along, without giving Dave
much time to look about. Evidently he was bound for
the company office. In fact, suddenly he said so.</p>

<p>“There’s the Planters’ Hotel, Red,” he spoke,
pointing. “It’s the biggest. The company’s office is
right across the street, kittycorner. See it?”</p>

<p>Kittycorner from the Planters’ Hotel (which was
a large three-story building, with a wide porch and a
verandah, too, running around its face) Dave saw a
sign reading, in big letters, “Russell, Majors &amp; Waddell,”
on a brick building. The streets hereabouts were
more crowded than at any other point, and the two
boys had difficulty in threading their way, dodging
people and horses and oxen and wagons.</p>

<p>“Better tie up here,” spoke Billy abruptly, his
quick eye sighting a vacant hitching spot at the sidewalk.
“This place is getting too populous for me;
can’t hardly breathe.”</p>

<p>They wedged in, tied their horses, and Billy led the
way to the Russell, Majors &amp; Waddell office—headquarters
of the great overland freighting firm.</p>

<p>“That’s Mr. Majors at the desk,” he informed,
undertone, to Dave, on the threshold. And—“How do
you do, Mr. Waddell?” he said respectfully, as another
man was brushing past them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span></p>

<p>“How-do-do, Billy,” responded the man. “Back
again, are you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, take care of yourself, my boy,” and Mr.
Waddell hastened away, as if on matters important.</p>

<p>“He’s the third partner,” whispered Billy. “But
you don’t see him very often. Mr. Majors and Mr.
Russell seem to run the plains part of the business.”</p>

<p>Mr. Waddell had been a stoutly-built man, with
florid complexion and full, heavy face inclining to jaw.
Mr. Majors was almost his opposite, being a rather
tall man, although strongly built, with a kindly, sober
face and a long brown beard. As Billy and Dave approached
his desk he glanced up.</p>

<p>“How do you do, Mr. Majors?” said Billy, hat in
hand.</p>

<p>“How are you, Billy?”</p>

<p>“This is my friend Dave Scott, Mr. Majors. He’s
looking for a job. He’s been staying at my house since
we came in last month with Lew Simpson’s train from
Laramie. I’m going out again in a day or so, and he
wants to get to work. We saw Mr. Russell up at the
fort, and he said for us to come down here to see you.”</p>

<p>“When did you see him?” queried Mr. Majors
crisply.</p>

<p>“We just come from him. He thought there might
be a job of herding open.”</p>

<p>“That boy’s pretty young.”</p>

<p>“He’s not any younger than I was when I started<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
in, Mr. Majors.” Billy spoke like a man, and Mr.
Majors appeared to regard him as a man.</p>

<p>“Where are your parents?” asked Mr. Majors of
Davy.</p>

<p>Dave gulped.</p>

<p>“I haven’t any. I was with my uncle.”</p>

<p>“Where’s he?”</p>

<p>Davy shook his head and gulped again. Billy
helped him out.</p>

<p>“The Injuns struck their wagon on the trail and
wiped them out, Mr. Majors. The Cut Nose band had
Dave, and he came into our train after that mule fort
fight. He made good with us; Lew Simpson and Wild
Bill and George Woods and everybody will say that;
and he’ll make good anywhere you put him, I believe.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mr. Majors, “if he has no folks
that’s a different matter. I don’t want to encourage
any boy to leave his home when he ought to be going
to school, and getting the right bringing up generally.
It’s a rough life for a boy or man either out on the
plains. Do you swear?” he demanded, suddenly.</p>

<p>Dave stammered.</p>

<p>“I don’t mean to. I don’t think I do.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” asserted Mr. Majors. “I won’t
have anybody around or working for our company who
blasphemes or lies. I won’t have it at all. There’s no
sense in swearing. All right then. I can put you at
herding, if you really want to work. We’ll pay you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
twenty-five dollars a month, the same as we pay all
herders. Got a horse?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” said Davy.</p>

<p>“That doesn’t matter. We’ll furnish you a mount,
of course. You can have the one that other herder’s
using. I hope you’ll make a better herder than most
of the others. Herding is a business just like any
other business, my boy. Whatever you do, do well.
If you make a good herder, we’ll give you a chance at
something more. Nearly everybody has to start in at
herding. Billy here did. Now he’s drawing full pay
with the wagon trains. He’ll tell you what to do. You
can sign the pay roll and start in this afternoon. Mr.
Meyers,” and Mr. Majors addressed his book-keeper,
“have this boy sign the pay roll and the pledge. He’s
going on herd, with the cattle out west of town.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Majors,” answered the book-keeper,
opening a large book. “Come over here, boy.”</p>

<p>Davy thought this rather sudden, but made no comment.
He walked boldly over to the book-keeper.</p>

<p>“Sign here,” bade Mr. Meyers, indicating with his
finger. And Davy wrote, in his best manner: “David
Scott.”</p>

<p>“Here’s something else,” bade the book-keeper.
“Better read it. We all have to sign it, if we work for
the company.”</p>

<p>Davy read the slip. It said:</p>

<p>“While I am in the employ of Russell, Majors &amp;
Waddell, I agree not to use profane language, not to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
get drunk, not to gamble, not to treat animals cruelly,
and not to do anything else that is incompatible with
the conduct of a gentleman. And I agree, if I violate
any of the above conditions, to accept my discharge
without any pay for my services.”</p>

<p>Mr. Majors had strolled over, to inspect, as Davy
signed. He nodded.</p>

<p>“I’m glad to see you can write, my boy,” he said.
“That’s more than some of the men can do. Billy
here had to make his mark the first time he signed
with us.”</p>

<p>“He can write now, though,” informed Davy,
loyally, remembering the scribbling on the wagon.
“I’ve seen him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Billy’s found out that he’s no worse off for
having put in some time at school. He’ll be glad
enough of all the school that he can get before he’s
gone much farther. Have you got bedding, my boy?”</p>

<p>“N-no, I haven’t,” faltered Davy. “Maybe I can
find some though.”</p>

<p>“We can rake up a quilt or two for you,” offered
Mr. Majors. But Billy spoke quickly.</p>

<p>“No; we’ll fix him out with bedding. We’ve some
extra quilts at the house, Mr. Majors. I’ll get them
on our way out.”</p>

<p>“Can you go out with him, Billy, and tell him what
to do? Number two herd is out six miles. You can
find it. Stop at the fort and tell Mr. Russell to furnish
him a mule.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“All right. You take him and post him.” Mr.
Majors extended his hand to Davy, who shook with
him. “Do your duty, and a little more whenever you
have the chance; don’t curse, don’t learn to drink,
keep Sunday as much as you can, read the Bible, and
look people in the face. Don’t do anything your mother
wouldn’t want you to do. I hope to hear a good report
of you. We need the right kind of men in the west,
and the boy like you will make the man of to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said Davy. “I’ll try.”</p>

<p>He followed Billy out; and they remounted their
ponies.</p>

<p>“Good,” remarked Billy, as they rode away up
the thronged street. “Mr. Majors is a queer sort, but
he’s the right stuff. He’s a crank on swearing and
drinking. We all have to sign that pledge, and if he
hears a man swearing he goes straight to him and
makes him quit. But everybody likes Mr. Majors,
and they all try to keep the pledge. Mr. Russell isn’t
so strict, though he backs up Mr. Majors. That’s a
new wrinkle to the plains—that pledge business.”</p>

<p>Davy nodded.</p>

<p>“There’s no sense in swearing, anyhow,” mused
Billy. “Jiminy, but my mother hated to have me
start out bull whacking. It’s a tough life, and some of
the teamsters, too, are about as tough as you make
’em. Ma saw Mr. Russell and Mr. Majors and they
talked with her and said they’d look out for me: and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
she read the pledge, and so she let me go. Lew Simpson
is a hard looker, you know. She didn’t like him
until she found out from Mr. Russell that he wasn’t
half as bad as he seemed. I’m mighty glad I’m here
to post you on that herding business. It’s no easy
job herding a thousand cattle. But you’ll make good.
All you have to do is to tend to your job. Mother’ll
fix you up with bedding, and if you need any clothes
that we haven’t got, you can get them on the company
account and they’ll take it out of your pay. See?”</p>

<p>So, Billy chatting and Davy listening, they trotted
along on the road up to the fort.</p>

<p>Mr. Russell was still at the quartermaster’s building
busy loading a bull train and checking it up. Billy
reported to him, and he nodded.</p>

<p>“All right,” he said. “On your way out you tell
Buck Bomer to give you a mule from his outfit.”</p>

<p>They found Buck in the wagon camp outside the
fort. He turned over to them a little mouse-colored
mule, with a rawhide bridle and an old stock saddle.
The bridle had rope lines and the saddle was worn and
ragged, and the saddle-blanket was a piece of sacking.
Altogether the equipment looked rather sorry, but
Davy said not a word. He made up his mind that he
would be better than his outfit.</p>

<p>“You don’t care,” consoled Billy. “It’s good
enough as a starter. If you need better you’ll get it
after a while. We’ll stop at the house, and get the other
stuff. Then we’ll go on. I know where the herd is.”</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<h2 class="nobreak" id="VI">VI<br />
<small>DAVY HAS AN ADVENTURE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>At least a thousand cattle were spread out, grazing
in the grassy bottom. Much of the grass was still
green, some patches had been cured by the sun; and
the broad expanse, under the blue sky, with the shadows
of the cattle now clearly cast by the setting sun, made
a pleasant picture. On the edges of the grazing herd
were the herders, sitting their horses or mules. The
canvas top of the mess wagon shone white beyond
the herd. Down the hill into the valley, and up the
opposite hill, out of the valley, were toiling slowly
two emigrant trains of wagons and people, following
the Overland Trail into the farther west.</p>

<p>“We’ll go over to the mess wagon and I’ll introduce
you; then I’ll skip back,” said Billy. “Stand in
with the cook, do what the boss tells you, mind your
own business, and you’ll get along fine. Don’t be
fresh, that’s all.”</p>

<p>Davy resolved that he would remember. He
wanted to be a success.</p>

<p>On their mounts they galloped across the turfy bottom,
and rounding the herd arrived at the mess wagon.
Smoke was already rising from the cook’s fire; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
the cook himself was moving about, from wagon to
fire, and fussing with his row of black kettles, set
beside the fire or atop the coals. The fire had been
made in a long shallow trench. The pots had covers
on them. Their steam smelled good.</p>

<p>The cook merely glanced up as the two boys approached.
Halting and dismounting nimbly, Billy
hailed him.</p>

<p>“Hello, Sam.”</p>

<p>The cook now paused and gazed. He was a short,
pudgy man, with a big bristly moustache and a broken
nose. He wore a wide brimmed hat and a floursack
apron, and boots. Odd enough he looked, cooking at
the fire.</p>

<p>“Hello, Billy. What’s the matter?”</p>

<p>“Nothing much. Sam, this is Dave Scott, a friend
of mine. He’s going on herd. Dave, shake hands
with Sam Bean, the best cook on the plains.”</p>

<p>Davy advanced and shook hands with Sam.</p>

<p>“Shucks,” mused Sam, surveying Dave. “Another
kid, is it? Who sent him out; the old man?”</p>

<p>“Yes; Mr. Majors. Mr. Russell, too.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Sam, proceeding with his cooking,
“I hope he’s a better kid than that other one we’ve
had. That lad was no good. All he thought of was
eatin’ an’ sleepin’.”</p>

<p>“Davy’ll make good, all right,” assured Billy,
loyally. “I’ll back him up on that. He came in with
us in Lew Simpson’s train.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span></p>

<p>“He’s the kid who left his shirt to the buffalo?”
queried Sam.</p>

<p>“You bet,” answered Billy.</p>

<p>“Huh!” grunted Sam, now surveying Davy with
new interest and a little respect.</p>

<p>“Where’s the boss?” asked Billy.</p>

<p>“Comin’,” said Sam, with jerk of his head.</p>

<p>A horseman was galloping in from the herd; but
part way he whirled, and went back again.</p>

<p>“That’s Hank Bassett, isn’t it?” asked Billy, keen
eyed. “He’s a good one, Dave. He’ll treat you right
if you don’t get fresh. Well, I reckon I’ll light out.
I’ll leave you with Sam. See you later.”</p>

<p>He shook hands with Dave and climbed on his
pony.</p>

<p>“Where you bound, Billy?” queried Sam.</p>

<p>“Going out again Thursday with Buck Bomer to
Laramie.”</p>

<p>“Good luck.”</p>

<p>“Same to you,” replied Billy, and rode away.
Looking back once, he waved his hand; Sam and Dave
waved answer.</p>

<p>“Might as well unpack your mule an’ lay out your
beddin’,” advised Sam, gruffly, to Dave. “Wouldn’t
unsaddle yet, though. Wait till the boss comes in.
Tie your mule to a wagon wheel.”</p>

<p>Davy promptly set about it; he unpacked his bedding,
and tied his mule.</p>

<p>“If you’re not too busy,” quoth Sam, sarcastically,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
“you might fetch me in some more buffalo chips, if
you can find ’em. There ought to be some, out a ways,
if those blamed emigrants ain’t cleaned ’em up. It’s
a wonder to me how far they’ll go lookin’ for fuel.
Here, take a sack.” And he tossed an old gunny sack
at Davy. “Jest pile ’em on it; don’t stop to stuff ’em
inside.”</p>

<p>Davy alertly seized the sacking, and started out.
He knew what buffalo chips were: the dried droppings
of the buffalo that used to roam by thousands
through the valley. They had been driven out of it,
largely by the traffic, but they had left their wallows
and their “chips.”</p>

<p>The chips had been well gleaned for other cooks,
and he must wander some distance from the wagon
before he found enough to pay for the picking up.
However, in due time he returned with all that the
sack could hold. The buffalo chips made a fine fire,
with little smoke and much heat. And they were easy
and cheap. Everybody used them in travelling across
the plains.</p>

<p>Sam grunted, whether pleased or not, as Davy
dumped the load by the fire.</p>

<p>“Now fetch me some fresh water from the creek,
will you?” bade Sam. “There’s a bucket.”</p>

<p>The creek was a side branch of the Salt Creek, and
both streams were running low; but Davy managed
to dip the bucket almost full of water. He brought it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
back. Sam grunted what might have been thanks
or not.</p>

<p>“There comes the boss,” he said.</p>

<p>The man on the white horse was galloping in again;
presently he dismounted at the fire. He was a tall
man, with scraggy beard, gray eyes and a very tanned
skin. He wore slouch hat, blue flannel shirt, jeans
trousers and boots. He glanced keenly at Dave.</p>

<p>“Here’s another kid for you to break in, Hank,”
informed the cook shortly.</p>

<p>“How’d you get here?” demanded Hank of Dave.</p>

<p>“Billy Cody fetched him out,” said the cook, over
his shoulder, from the wagon.</p>

<p>“Who sent him?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Russell and Mr. Majors told me to come out
and help herd,” answered Davy, speaking for himself.</p>

<p>“Did you ever herd before?”</p>

<p>“No, sir; except with an emigrant train. I herded
horses and cattle there some.”</p>

<p>“Have you crossed the plains?”</p>

<p>“Just part way.”</p>

<p>“He’s the kid the Injuns had when they corralled
Simpson and Woods and little Billy, out near Cedar
Bluffs last summer,” reported Sam the cook. “Billy
says he’s all right.”</p>

<p>“Well, he’s a different color, anyhow,” remarked
Hank, referring to Davy’s red head. “How old are
you?”</p>

<p>“Ten going on ’leven,” replied Davy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span></p>

<p>“What’s your name?”</p>

<p>“David Scott. Billy and the others call me ‘Red.’”</p>

<p>“Got any folks?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Injuns wiped ’em out,” informed Sam the cook.
“Remember?”</p>

<p>Hank nodded.</p>

<p>“Yes. All right,” he continued, in tone more
kindly, to Dave; “you can help the cook to-night. In
the morning you can go on herd, and see if you can
hold the job. That red thatch ought to give you plenty
of spunk, anyhow!”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said Davy, encouraged.</p>

<p>Two herders came in for supper, leaving one on
guard over the herd. They were rough-appearing
men, and Davy and his red head had to take considerable
banter and joking. He stood that well. He tried
not to be “fresh” or impertinent; and when he didn’t
know what he ought to say he said nothing and only
grinned. After a while the men seemed to accept him
as a pretty good kind of a boy. The fact that Billy
Cody had vouched for him was a great help.</p>

<p>That night Davy slept on the ground again (as he
had slept when with the wagon trains), rolled in his
quilts, his saddle for a pillow. Breakfast was called
before sunrise; and after breakfast he went out on
herd.</p>

<p>“You’ll be eight hours on and four off,” instructed
Hank, “except when you ride in for meals. Tend to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
business and don’t bother the cattle except when they’re
straying. They’re here to rest and get their flesh on.
When they stray too far turn ’em back, but don’t run
’em. I suppose Billy told you about what to do, didn’t
he?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; he told me to look out for Indians and
emigrants passing through.”</p>

<p>There were two herders for the herd to which Davy
was appointed. Davy thought that he was lucky in
his partner, whose name was the Reverend Benjamin
Baxter. When the other men had called him “Reverend,”
Davy thought they were joking; but he found
out that Mr. Baxter actually was a minister of the
gospel. He was a pleasant-faced, thin young man,
with dark eyes and hollow cheeks, and an occasional
cough. Evidently he was out on the plains for his
health. His home was Massachusetts; but in his plains
garb and his tan he looked as much of a Westerner as
any Missourian. Yes, Davy was lucky to be paired
off with Mr. Baxter, who had been well educated and
whom everybody seemed to like because, while he was
a “preacher” he was also much of a man.</p>

<p>“You ride around your half of the herd and I’ll
ride around my half, Davy,” said Mr. Baxter.
“When we’re about to meet we’ll turn back. Take
things easy. You don’t have to ride every minute,
you know; just enough to keep the cattle from straying
out where they’re liable to get out of sight or be picked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
up by somebody passing. I’ll let you know when it’s
time to go in for dinner.”</p>

<p>The herding did not strike Davy as hard work,
except that it was rather monotonous and steady. It
was more interesting at first than later. The cattle,
spread out loosely over a wide area, required considerable
of a ride along their edges. They were all
work cattle—steers or oxen, young and old, used for
hauling the wagons of the Russell, Majors &amp; Waddell
“bull trains.” Some were decrepit, worn out in the
hard service across the plains; others were yet strong,
and needed only rest and feed. In the beginning Davy
bestirred himself more than was required; he was so
afraid lest any of them might stray too far. Soon
he was sharp enough to note that as long as they were
only grazing, and he could keep his eyes on them, the
stragglers might be permitted to have a little freedom
to pick the best grass. In fact, the whole herd constantly
shifted ground, gradually moving on from
clump to clump and patch to patch.</p>

<p>About the middle of the morning Mr. Baxter’s first
shift of eight hours was up, and another herder relieved
him.</p>

<p>“Now I’ll take a sleep,” he called back, gaily,
to Dave as he galloped for the wagon. “Have to
sleep when we can, you know.”</p>

<p>Davy continued his herding with the new partner—who
was gruff and silent, very different from Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
Baxter. However, that made little difference, for
herding did not give much chance to gossip.</p>

<p>At noon Davy was sent in for his turn at dinner;
and when his four hours recess arrived he was glad
to dismount at the wagon and lie in the shade. After
he had served half the night on night guard and had
not made any mistakes, when he crawled in, in the
chill and dark, under his quilts, and settled for his short
sleep, he felt like a veteran.</p>

<p>So the days and nights passed, of long hours in
the saddle and short hours afoot. The bull herd moved
from pasturage to pasturage, with Sam and his mess
wagon keeping handy. The days were sunny fall, the
nights were crisp, the air pure except for the dust stirred
up by the hoofs of the herd or sometimes drifting from
the great trail, the cattle gave little trouble, the mess
food was plenty although about the same every meal,
and herding on the plains proved not such a disagreeable
business as might have been expected.</p>

<p>The chief annoyance was the rattlesnakes—although
Sam and Hank and several others claimed that
the emigrants and the cattle had cleaned about all the
snakes out. However, on his first day Davy rode over
two, and scarcely a day passed that he did not see three
or four. He was told that he must not let one bite his
mule, for mules often died from snake bite. Horses
and cattle seemed stronger; anyway, the cattle of the
bull herd seemed to be what Mr. Baxter called “snake<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
educated”; Davy could tell from their movements
that a rattlesnake was near them.</p>

<p>The most interesting part of herding was the sight
of the travel on the great Overland Trail. The Trail
entered the Salt Creek Valley by a hill on the east and
left it by a hill on the west; and at any hour of the day
the white-topped wagons of emigrant train and freight
train could be seen descending and crossing and ascending,
some bound to Leavenworth, but the majority
bound westward for the plains trip.</p>

<p>Where they all were going Davy used to wonder.
It seemed as though everybody from the East was
moving into the far West. Of course, some of the
emigrants were bound for western Kansas, where in
Arapahoe County, at the base of the Rocky Mountains,
people were seeking for gold. Some were hoping
to take up farms in Kansas. Others were aiming for
the Salt Lake region, where the Mormons under
Brigham Young had settled. And others were bound
clear across the continent to California for gold and
for land. And many did not know exactly where they
were going, except that they were moving west, ever
west, to found new homes. The freight trains of the
great Russell, Majors &amp; Waddell Company were carrying
government stores to Fort Kearney, in Nebraska,
and Fort Laramie, also of Nebraska, on the North
Platte, and Fort Bridger, in Utah, and Salt Lake,
where troops had been sent last winter. The dusty
trail, bordered by camps old and new, and by abandoned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
pots and pans and boxes and clothing and deserted
skeletons of cattle and horses, was never vacant,
night or day. Whenever the herding business led
Davy near to it he viewed it with wonder.</p>

<p>Herding took all of Davy’s time. Occasionally
Hank Bassett went into Leavenworth, and occasionally
the other men rode in—all but Mr. Baxter. He and
Davy stayed out. The weather continued clear and
pleasant, with the days soft and sunny, and the nights
crisp and still. Nobody paid much attention to Davy
now, for he was proving a good herder, and was accepted
as a member of the herding mess. He was as
hard as nails, everything he ate tasted good, long hours
on mule back did not stiffen him, and he thought that
he knew every steer in the big herd.</p>

<p>One big steer he especially watched. It was a large
red and white steer, with a sore hoof which did not
heal. Every now and again a portion of the herd was
separated and driven in to Fort Leavenworth for another
trip across the plains; and new bunches took
their places, to rest up again. But the old red and
white steer stayed. He was foot sore, but he also was
a wanderer, for he loved to stray. Several times during
each day he would edge out farther and farther, leading
some of his cronies; and in due time Davy must
ride in front of him and turn him back. He was a
pesky animal, and caused much trouble; the third
herder wanted him killed, but Davy and Mr. Baxter
only laughed and kept persuading Hank to save him.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
After all, he was only a steer, with a mind of his own.
Maybe he would get well. Davy rather hoped that he
wouldn’t; he seemed to have such a good time, and
the worked cattle were so gaunt and scarred when
they returned from their long, hard trips.</p>

<p>Now it was November of 1858. The days were
shorter, the nights were colder, the grass was failing,
and Indian summer was about to end. Soon the herds
would be taken off the plains, for the snow was due
and there would not be enough feed. One day Mr.
Baxter was ill in camp; the other herder was off, and
Davy found himself left on herd alone for a brief
time. This he did not mind. He felt capable of handling
the herd himself. So he slowly rode around and
around, occasionally halting for a survey of the landscape.</p>

<p>This week the herd had drifted farther than usual
from the trail and from the settlements, to the very
edge of the Salt Creek Valley, where in numerous
pockets amidst low hill the grass was still abundant.
Davy never understood exactly how it happened, but
all of a sudden he missed the red and white lame ox.
His eyes ran rapidly over the herd, seeking the old
fellow. The red and white ox was a “marker”; when
he was present then the chances were that the herd was
holding together, but when he was absent then something
must be done at once.</p>

<p>Well, he was absent; he was not even in sight. This
meant that probably he had led off a dozen or so followers.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
From his mule Davy cast keen gaze over the
herd and over the surrounding rolling country.</p>

<p>“Gwan!” he ordered to his mouse-colored mule,
and striking into a gallop he set off on a wide circle.</p>

<p>From the top of the nearest rise he saw nothing
moving. But the top of the second gave him a wide
view—and he saw something of much interest. There,
about half a mile from him, and out in the open, was
a line of moving dots. He made out the red and
white steer—he recognized the color and the limp. At
least a dozen other cattle were with him. They were
strung out in a little group; and behind, several horsemen
were driving them. Yes, actually driving them!
Indians! Indians were driving off a bunch of strays!</p>

<p>Davy’s heart skipped a beat and suddenly thumped
violently. But he didn’t sit looking long. Not he. He
knew what Billy Cody would do, and he knew what
any herder with spunk would do. He clapped his heels
against his mule and away he went straight for the
Indians.</p>

<p>They might be Kickapoos. Kickapoos from the
reservation frequently visited the cattle camps to beg
for food and clothes; and many of them would carry
off more than was given to them. A sick steer was
their especial delight. They picked up strays, too,
when they could. So likely enough these Indians were
Kickapoos. Davy was not afraid of Kickapoos, although,
of course, any Indian might be surly when he
had the advantage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span></p>

<p>On galloped Davy, urging his mule. The Indians
had seen him, for they tried to quicken their pace;
but the lame steer held them back. Good for the lame
steer, who could not travel fast! So Davy rapidly
drew nearer.</p>

<p>As he approached he made up his mind that these
were not Kickapoos. They wore blankets like any
Indians, but their hair was not worn like that of Kickapoos,
whose hair was combed back smoothly. And
they were not Osages—another reservation tribe of
Kansas. The hair of the Osages was roached like a
rooster’s comb. No; by their braids and by the way
they rode these were Cheyennes or Sioux! Whew!
That was bad.</p>

<p>They did not even glance around as Davy rode
upon them. Still at a gallop he rode around them, and
whirling short, bravely throwing up his hand, halted
squarely in the path. The baker’s dozen of steers
(there were thirteen of them) bunched and stopped,
panting. The Indians stared fixedly at Davy; two of
them rode forward.</p>

<p>Yes, they were Cheyennes, except one Sioux; and
the leader was Tall Bull!</p>

<p>“What are you doing with those cattle?” demanded
Davy.</p>

<p>“Go. Our cattle,” grunted Tall Bull.</p>

<p>“They aren’t, either,” retorted Davy. “They’re
my cattle from that herd yonder.”</p>

<p>“No,” denied Tall Bull, angrily; his companion’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
eyes were blazing. Davy felt them, and the hot eyes
of the four other Indians, in the rear. “You go.
Our cattle.”</p>

<p>“Where’d you get them, then?” demanded Davy.</p>

<p>“Buy ’em. Take ’em an’ eat ’em. Puckachee!
(Get out!)”</p>

<p>“Puckachee yourself,” answered Davy, now
angry. “You can’t have ’em. I take ’em back.
Savvy? They belong to Russell, Majors &amp; Waddell.
See that brand?”</p>

<p>The two Indians grunted one to another. The
Indians behind called in their own language.</p>

<p>“Get out of the way,” ordered Davy, boldly. “Gee,
Buck! Whitey! Gee-haw!”</p>

<p>The cattle began to turn; but Tall Bull interposed
by reining his pony and forcing them around again.</p>

<p>“No whoa-haws; ours. Buy ’em. How much?”</p>

<p>“Can’t sell ’em. Whoa-haw cattle. Gee, Buck!
Get out of the way, you two.”</p>

<p>“Give one. Give one, take rest.”</p>

<p>“No!” stormed Davy, stoutly. “None.”</p>

<p>The Indians all were armed with bows and arrows.
Suddenly the old Indian with Tall Bull strung his bow
like lightning, fitted arrow to string, and Davy found
the steel head quivering on taut string within six inches
of his chest. The black eyes of the Indian glared into
his, the swarthy face was fierce with a scowl of hatred.</p>

<p>Davy did not dare to move; even if he had had a
gun or pistol he could not have used it. The arrow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
would have been through him before he could pull
trigger. There he must sit, waiting for the string to
be released. His flesh in front of the arrow point
shrank and stung, as if already the keen point had
driven into it. If the Indian’s finger should slip—!</p>

<p>Half a minute passed; it seemed to Davy like an
hour. Tall Bull spoke again.</p>

<p><a href="#i_fp098">“Two; give two,” he urged meaningly. “Take
rest.”</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_fp098">

  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><a href="#Page_98">“TWO; GIVE TWO,” HE URGED, MEANINGLY. “TAKE REST”</a></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Davy shook his head. He felt white and queer, but
his mind was made up.</p>

<p>“No,” he answered, trying to speak naturally, but
suspecting that his voice was rather shaky. “None.”</p>

<p>The arrow head was still at his breast; the Indian’s
bow was still stretched taut until it quivered with the
strain; the Indian’s eyes glared, his face scowled.
Davy did not glance aside. He was afraid to.</p>

<p>“One,” now urged Tall Bull. “Boy give one, or
mebbe boy die an’ lose all.”</p>

<p>Davy shook his head.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>Now another Indian rode forward. With the
corner of his eye Davy saw that he was the Sioux.
The Sioux spoke to the two Cheyennes; they grunted
answer, and the bow of the old warrior slowly relaxed,
as if it hated to.</p>

<p>The Sioux extended his hand to Davy. He was a
young buck, and good looking, with a sober cast of
features.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span></p>

<p>“How, cola? (How do you do, friend?)” he said;
and Davy shook hands with him. “All right. Brave
boy. You go. Take cattle. Goodby.”</p>

<p>“Goodby,” said Davy. He promptly turned the
lame steer aside and the others followed. He did not
delay a moment. Would the Indians try to stop him
again? No; they let him work. Driving the steers he
started on the back trail, past the three Indians in the
rear. Every moment he expected to feel an arrow
plump into him between his shoulders; but he did not
even look around. He attended to business. When at
last he did look around, the six Indians were riding
along at a jog. Davy quickened his pace, and when he
arrived with his little bunch at the herd he was glad
indeed.</p>

<p>He had proved his mettle. He felt that nobody
would have done better.</p>

<small>DAVY CHANGES JOBS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The Reverend Mr. Baxter came on herd soon; and
Davy told him about the Indians.</p>

<p>“You might have let them go, Davy,” said Mr.
Baxter, “and nobody would have blamed you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; but I couldn’t,” answered Davy.</p>

<p>“Well,” mused Mr. Baxter, gazing at him with a
rueful smile, “I don’t believe I could either. But lots
of fellows would. Six armed Indians are rather many
for one unarmed boy to tackle. But right makes
might, Davy.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Davy. “I guess it does.”</p>

<p>Anyway, Hank Bassett and Sam the cook and the
other men in the camp congratulated Davy on his
spunk, until he wished that Billy Cody was there to
know. But Billy was out with the bull train, and
nobody might say when he would turn up again at this
end of the trail.</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll send you in with a part of the herd
to-morrow, Red,” quoth Hank, as if that were a reward
for Davy’s pluck. “How’d you like to see Leavenworth
again?”</p>

<p>“First-rate, Mr. Bassett,” answered Davy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span></p>

<p>“You and the Reverend can drive a bunch in as
soon as we cut ’em out in the morning. Then you’d
better report at the office. I don’t think we’ll need you
out here till spring.”</p>

<p>That was good word—at least, the Leavenworth
trip was. Davy felt as though he would be glad to
see people and buildings again and mingle with the
world. Besides, he would be paid off at last, and
would have a pocket full of money well earned.</p>

<p>“All right, Davy,” spoke Mr. Baxter, with a grin.
“We’ll take in the sights and buy a suit of clothes to
boot, won’t we!”</p>

<p>Davy nodded happily.</p>

<p>The herd had drifted near to the great trail again,
so he and Mr. Baxter drove their bunch along that
route for the fort where they were to be delivered to
the company. Riding behind in the dust on one flank
while Mr. Baxter rode on the other, Davy felt like a
veteran.</p>

<p>The fort was eight miles distant, about three hours
drive if they did not hurry. The best of the steers
had been cut out from the main herd, so that without
difficulty or pushing the trip might easily be made in
less than three hours. The trail was still lively, with
bull trains and overlanders making their best speed
westward, to cross to their destination before the fall
storms set in.</p>

<p>One outfit, drawing aside to give the cattle room,
hailed Davy with a question. It was an emigrant outfit,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
of a farm wagon covered with dingy cotton-cloth
hood, hauled by a yoke of oxen. A woman holding a
baby peered from the seat; a boy and girl about Davy’s
age trudged alongside, a sallow, whiskered man, walking,
drove with an ox-goad, and a younger man rode
a mule.</p>

<p>“How much further to the Cherry Creek gold
diggin’s, young feller?” queried the whiskered man.</p>

<p>“About seven hundred miles,” answered Davy.</p>

<p>“When can we see the mountings?” quavered the
woman, anxiously.</p>

<p>“Oh, goodness!” laughed Davy. “Not for a long
time. You’ve got to cross the plains yet.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t think it was so fur,” she sighed. “Do
you hear they’re findin’ lots of gold there?”</p>

<p>“You didn’t come from out thar, did you?” asked
the younger man.</p>

<p>“No,” said Davy. “We’ve been herding in the
valley here.”</p>

<p>“Keep going and you’ll arrive sometime,” called
Mr. Baxter. And he and Davy passed on.</p>

<p>“That’s pretty tough, Dave,” he spoke across as
they proceeded in the one direction while the wagon
proceeded in the other. “Those people haven’t any
more idea where the Cherry Creek country is than these
cattle have; but there they go, woman and baby and
all. They’ll find what seven hundred miles of ox
travel means before they get through. And then they’re
liable to be disappointed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t you think there’s any gold out there?”
asked Davy.</p>

<p>“Oh, folks have been panning out a little gold for
half a dozen years, but it hasn’t amounted to shucks.
I’d rather take my chances herding cattle. Expect
we’ll know more about it soon now. A gang are out
there from Georgia, who know how to mine; and the
governor sent out another gang from Lawrence last
summer, you know, to locate a town and report back.”</p>

<p>That was so. Davy was familiar with the name
“Cherry Creek,” which seemed to be a new gold region
lying out at the foot of the Rocky Mountains, near
Pike’s Peak. But, like Mr. Baxter, the majority of the
herders and teamsters seemed to put little stock in it.
They were waiting to “see color,” as some of them
who had been to Salt Lake and to California put it.</p>

<p>Behind, a little party of travellers eastward bound
along the trail were overtaking the herd. There were
three of them mule-back, driving a couple of pack
mules. As they passed on Mr. Baxter’s side they
cheered and waved good-naturedly.</p>

<p>“Hurrah for Cherry Creek!” they hallooed.
“You’re heading the wrong way, pardner.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Turn around and make your fortune. That’s
why.”</p>

<p>“Already made it,” retorted Mr. Baxter.</p>

<p>“How, stranger?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span></p>

<p>“Herding cattle at twenty-five a month and grub.
Have you made yours?”</p>

<p>“Mighty near. We’ve seen gold. The Georgia
crowd’s been finding it. We’re just back from the
Cherry Creek diggin’s. Thar’s plenty color thar, we
tell you.”</p>

<p>“Show me some.”</p>

<p>“Hain’t got it, stranger. But it’s thar. We’re
goin’ back in the spring. Better join us. Go out an’
buy lots in St. Charles City.”</p>

<p>“No, sir. Buy ’em in Auraria, across the creek,”
shouted another. “Auraria’s booming; St. Charles
won’t last.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” laughed Mr. Baxter. “I’ll think about
it. Just now twenty-five dollars in the pocket seems
better than nothing in a hole in the ground.”</p>

<p>“Wall, you’ll miss out,” warned one of the men
as the little party pressed on in a great hurry.</p>

<p>Mr. Baxter laughed and bantered all the way in to
Leavenworth.</p>

<p>“We want to see some of that gold before we pack
up and go on a wild goose chase, don’t we, Davy?”
he called. “And I’d rather have a yoke of steers on
the hoof than a city lot on paper.”</p>

<p>This sounded like wisdom; but Davy imagined
what an effect the report of those returned Cherry
Creekers would have on that emigrant wagon! The
men and the woman would be looking for the mountains
more eagerly than ever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span></p>

<p>He and Mr. Baxter turned the bunch of cattle over
to the Russell, Majors &amp; Waddell’s foreman at the fort,
where another bull train was being made up, loaded
high with government supplies for the west. Buck
Bomer, Billy Cody’s wagon-master, had not come in
yet from the Laramie trip, and there was no news
from Billy himself. He was still out. Report said
that he had gone on from Laramie to another fort, so
nobody could tell when he would be back.</p>

<p>From the post Davy and Mr. Baxter rode on down
to Leavenworth City. Leavenworth never had seemed
so busy. New buildings had gone up, the streets were
crowded with people and teams, and the levee was
lined with steamboats bound north and south. But
the people all were bound west. They had gathered
from every quarter of the States. The twang of the
Yankee, the drawl of the backwoodsman, and soft slur
of the Southerner mingled in a regular hubbub.</p>

<p>Mr. Majors was in his office; Mr. Russell was out
somewhere on the trail; Mr. Waddell was down home
at Lexington, Missouri, visiting his family. And who
should be sitting in a chair in the office but Wild Bill
Hickok—as handsome and as gentlemanly as ever.</p>

<p>“Hello, there,” hailed Wild Bill. “How goes it?”</p>

<p>Mr. Baxter nodded cheerily at him.</p>

<p>“Fine,” answered Davy, feeling rather awkward
in his worn-out old clothes and his long hair, but not
ashamed of what he had been doing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span></p>

<p>“I hear you’re making good, boy,” asserted Wild
Bill. “I reckon you can hold your own as well as
Billy.”</p>

<p>“He certainly can,” claimed Mr. Baxter. “He’s
the hero of the camp.”</p>

<p>“Bassett sent you in, did he?” queried Mr.
Majors. “How are things at the camp?”</p>

<p>“Same as usual, Mr. Majors,” answered Mr.
Baxter. “Davy’s a hero now, I suppose you’ve heard.”</p>

<p>Mr. Majors nodded with his long beard.</p>

<p>“So they say,” he replied simply. “Well, we’re
reducing our force out in the cattle camps now, so
you two needn’t go back this fall. The cashier’ll pay
you off. And—Dick,” he continued to the cashier,
“give Davy an order for a suit of clothes with the
company’s compliments. Make it clothes, shoes and
hat complete.”</p>

<p>Davy blushed hotly, and didn’t know quite what to
do. That the word of his adventure with the Indians
had reached the office so quickly was very embarrassing.
But he was glad to get some clothes, and Mr.
Majors had spoken in earnest, so it would have been
bad taste in him to make much ado about what he had
or hadn’t done. Mr. Majors wasn’t a man to say what
he didn’t mean, or to offer more than anybody deserved.
So Davy stammered “Thank you, Mr.
Majors,” and, clapped heartily on the back by Mr.
Baxter, went forward to the cashier.</p>

<p>“Here you are,” said the cashier, shoving out the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
money and the order. “What’s the news out yonder?
Anybody booming Cherry Creek?”</p>

<p>“Yes. A bunch of men who claimed they were
from there passed us coming in,” answered Mr. Baxter.
“They had a big story about plenty of gold, but we
noticed they didn’t show any!”</p>

<p>“Color talks,” remarked Wild Bill. “When I see
color I’m going out thar but not before.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we’ll all wait a bit,” commented Mr. Majors.</p>

<p>“Those new towns out there will make more
freight business, Mr. Majors,” said Mr. Baxter.</p>

<p>“Shouldn’t wonder. We’re hauling down from
Laramie for them now, and up from Bent’s Fort on
the Santa Fe trail. There’ll have to be a new trail
straight across, eventually. But we’ve got about all
the business we can handle. The government work
alone takes thirty-five hundred wagons, four thousand
men and over forty thousand oxen. We’ve hauled
over sixteen million pounds of government freight,
most of it clear through to Utah.”</p>

<p>Nearly four thousand wagons, four thousand men,
forty thousand bulls! Davy gasped. It certainly was
a big company, and he was proud to be working for
Russell, Majors &amp; Waddell, even if he was only one
in the four thousand.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mr. Majors, “I want to thank you
two <em>men</em> for your faithful service and if there’s anything
more I can do for you let me know. Baxter, I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
suppose you can take care of yourself for a while.
What are you going to do, my boy?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Davy, in doubt. “Get
another job, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Save your money. Don’t spend it foolishly. If
you want to put it on deposit with us we’ll give you a
receipt for it; then you’ll be sure of having it as you
need it.”</p>

<p>Davy fingered the gold pieces, making his pocket
warm and heavy. There were seven ten-dollar pieces
and one five-dollar piece. He would have liked to
carry them all around for a time until he could show
them to Billy Cody or Billy’s mother. But Mr.
Majors’ offer sounded sensible, so he fished out the ten-dollar
pieces and passed them over to the cashier.</p>

<p>“I’ll keep five dollars,” he said.</p>

<p>“What are you and the Reverend going to do?”
queried Wild Bill. “That is, if it’s any of my business.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Davy can range around with me for a while
till he’s settled,” answered Mr. Baxter. “First thing,
we’ll get a hair cut. I’m going down to St. Louis later,
where I’ve got some folks.”</p>

<p>“Lookee here, Davy,” pursued Wild Bill; “if you
haven’t any pressing engagement come on out to the
Cody ranch with me. I’m going to ride over thar and
the Reverend can do as he pleases. The Codys will
sure be glad to see you. Mebbe you can get a job for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
your schooling this winter. Thar’s a fine school opened
again near the Codys, I hear.”</p>

<p>“That’s right. Go to school while you can. You’ll
never regret it,” put in Mr. Majors. “Then when all
this country’s settled up and you’re among people who
can read and write and figure, you won’t be ashamed.
Besides, you’ll command more wages. The school
house and the church are of more value to this country
than the ox teams. The people with schools and
churches are here to stay and grow.”</p>

<p>Davy wanted to see the Cody family again, but it
seemed rather tame to be going to school when he
might be riding the plains. He hesitated a moment
until Mr. Baxter said:</p>

<p>“Billy Cody goes to school when he’s home. He’s
found out that a little education helps a fellow along.
I shouldn’t wonder if his mother turned him into
school again this winter when he gets back.”</p>

<p>Since Billy Cody the “Boy Scout” went to school
there must be something in it worth while. Davy began
to feel that maybe he, too, who was a kind of hero,
could afford to take a little time off from making himself
famous and attend to making himself more of an
all-round man.</p>

<p>“All right,” he said to Wild Bill. “I’ll go and see,
anyway.” He shook hands with Mr. Baxter, who
promised to keep track of him, and left with Wild Bill.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cody and the girls and Turk the dog were
glad indeed to see them. Davy must answer all their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
questions as to what he had done since he had been
there last. He did not mean to say anything about his
adventure with the Indians, but Wild Bill told it and
praised him, and then there was more ado.</p>

<p>“Billy’ll be pleased to hear that,” declared Mrs.
Cody. And she sighed. “I wish he were home.”</p>

<p>“Have you heard from him, Mother Cody?” inquired
Wild Bill.</p>

<p>“He sent us word from Fort Laramie that he was
going on with a train for another post.”</p>

<p>“He sent us some money, too,” cried Helen,
proudly.</p>

<p>“Billy’s a good boy, all right,” nodded Wild Bill.</p>

<p>“I wish he were home, though,” insisted Mrs. Cody,
quietly. “He ought to have more schooling. These
girls will be far ahead of him. Lack of education
will be a great handicap to him after he gets out among
cultured people.”</p>

<p>“That’s what we’ve been telling Davy here,” quoth
Wild Bill. “The winter’s no time for him to be on the
plains, anyway. He’d better be going to school till
things open up in the spring. Do you reckon he could
get a place hereabouts where he could work for his
keep while he went to school? ’Tisn’t a right place for
a boy in Leavenworth.”</p>

<p>“Why,” mused Mrs. Cody, flushing, “we’ve always
got room for Davy or any friend of Billy’s or
yours, Mr. Hickok. Of course, there isn’t much work
for an extra hand. You see, when Billy left he hired<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
a man to tend to the farm. But if Davy’ll stay he’s
welcome.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Davy’ll stay!” cried the girls, dancing gaily;
and Turk barked. “You will stay, won’t you, Davy?
We’ll have lots of fun.”</p>

<p>But Davy promptly shook his head.</p>

<p>“I think you’ve got enough,” he said. Mrs. Cody
did not look at all strong, and the girls were little.
“I guess I’d rather find a place where I can work
enough to pay for my keep.”</p>

<p>“Well,” resumed Mrs. Cody, “maybe you would
feel more independent, Davy, although you’re welcome
to stay right here as long as you like. But there’s a
new family on a claim about a mile and a half over
yonder. The man’s sick and his wife’s doing too much
work. I expect they’d be glad of somebody to tend
to the chores. You might go over and see.”</p>

<p>“Come ahead, Davy,” bade Bill.</p>

<p>“You’ll be back and have supper with us and stay
all night, won’t you?” invited Mrs. Cody, quickly.</p>

<p>“We’ll get Dave settled first, thank you, Mother
Cody,” called back Bill. “Then we’ll be mighty glad
to stop off if we come this way.”</p>

<p>“Goodby, Dave,” called the girls. “There’s a
splendid school started. We’re all going.”</p>

<p>With Bill, Dave rode to the settler’s house spoken of
by Mrs. Cody. That was tremendously kind of Wild
Bill, to go to so much trouble for just a boy; but Davy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
found out that this Mr. Hickok was the kind of a man
who would do anything for anybody deserving it.</p>

<p>The new family’s name was Shields. They were
from Massachusetts. Mr. Shields had taken up a
homestead of 160 acres, and now he was miserable
with fever and ague, so that he was unable to work
steadily. He and Mrs. Shields and the baby had come
by railroad to St. Louis and by steamboat from St.
Louis to Leavenworth. There they had loaded their
goods into a wagon drawn by a yoke of oxen and had
settled on this claim where they had found a cabin
already standing.</p>

<p>It wasn’t much of a cabin, being only twelve by
eighteen feet square, and built of logs. The floor was
of rough boards with wide cracks between them; torn
muslin was stretched as a ceiling to keep the dirt of
the sod roof from sifting down. Over the walls Mrs.
Shields had pasted newspapers, right side up, so she
could read them sometimes as she worked. A muslin
curtain, hung on a wire, divided the room; behind the
curtain was a bed, of poles laid on notched posts and a
mattress stuffed with hay. Clothes were hung on
wooden pegs. On the other side of the curtain was a
cook stove, and a table of rough-sawed slabs, and a
couple of stools.</p>

<p>No, it wasn’t much of a place for people like Mr.
and Mrs. Shields, who were used to a comfortable
house in Massachusetts; but it was home.</p>

<p>All this Davy found out in due time, while he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
worked for his board and lodging. At night he slept
on the floor by the stove; and he must rise at daylight
to milk the cow and feed the cow and the oxen and the
few chickens, and split the wood and bring the water
from the well, and make an early start for school,
which was four miles away. After school and on Saturdays
he had other chores waiting, and drove the
oxen while Mr. Shields held the plough to break the
sod for the spring sowing.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="VIII">VIII<br />
<small>THE GOLD FEVER</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Even while Davy had been herding a change had
occurred in this Salt Creek Valley. The number of
settlers seemed almost to have doubled, and cabins and
houses and ploughed fields were everywhere. Amidst
them ran the Leavenworth end of the great Overland
Trail. Until after the first snows the emigrants and
settlers toiled along it, down the hill into the valley
and up the hill out of the valley; and all winter the bull
trains plodded back and forth. Weather rarely stopped
the Russell, Majors &amp; Waddell outfits.</p>

<p>Mr. DeVinne was the teacher in the school. It
was the best school yet, according to the Cody girls,
because there were more pupils, and Mr. DeVinne
seemed to know how to teach. Of course the school
was not graded; it consisted of only one room, where
the boys and girls sat on long benches, with other
benches for desks. The scholars ranged from little
Eliza Cody, who was six, up to big boys of twenty.
The pupils had come from all over—from Missouri,
Illinois, Vermont, Carolina, Mississippi, and the other
States east and south. Davy, who had been herding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
for Russell, Majors &amp; Waddell, and had proved his
pluck, felt as big as any of them.</p>

<p>Steve Gobel, who tried to be a kind of boss (when
Billy Cody wasn’t there), started in to tease Davy, who
was little and red-headed. Davy stood the teasing as
long as he could; but when Steve grabbed his hair and
pulled, saying: “Here, Red! Lemme warm my
fingers,” Davy flared up. He would have fought Steve
then and there, but another boy sprang between them.</p>

<p>“You’d better let him alone, Steve Gobel, or Billy
Cody’ll give you another licking.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he will!” cried Helen Cody and all the girls.
“He’s coming back pretty soon now.”</p>

<p>“Aw, he never licked me. He ain’t big enough,”
snarled Steve.</p>

<p>“Well, he’s man enough, whether he’s big enough
or not,” retorted the boys. And——</p>

<p>“He did, too, lick you. And he’ll do it again as
soon as he gets home,” called the Cody girls, loyally.</p>

<p>Steve growled, but he strolled off and after that he
let Davy pretty much alone. Davy learned that Steve
had bullied Billy Cody, too—until in a fight Billy had
been made mad enough to hurt him. Billy was the
school’s hero, for he was out on the plains doing a
man’s work and helping to support his mother and
sisters. Everybody liked Billy if they knew him, or
they wanted to see him if they didn’t know him.</p>

<p>The cold, snowy winter of Kansas and a new West
set in. The days and nights were below zero, blizzards<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
of wind and snow swept through plains and
valleys; and in the frontier cabins the settlers schemed
hard to keep warm. His chores at the Shields cabin
and his trips to school and back kept Davy busy; but he
must make the best of his school term, for when winter
quit school would quit too. Once in a while he stopped
in at the Cody home; Mrs. Cody was putting up a large
house as a hotel and eating place for the overland
travellers, particularly the teamsters of the wagon
trains. The girls named it “The Valley Grove House.”</p>

<p>Then, in February, who should appear at school but
Billy himself.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! There’s Billy Cody!”</p>

<p>“Hello, Red!”</p>

<p>“Hello, Billy.”</p>

<p>“When did you get back, Billy?” asked everybody.</p>

<p>“Yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Where’ve you been this time?”</p>

<p>“Out to Laramie and Fort Walbach at Cheyenne
Pass. Been trapping on the Chugwater, south of Laramie,
too.”</p>

<p>“How’d you come back? With a bull train?”</p>

<p>“Nope. A couple of fellows and I started with
our own pack outfit, but the Injuns jumped us on the
Little Blue, and we ran into snow, and we mighty nigh
never got through.”</p>

<p>“What you going to do now, Billy?”</p>

<p>“Going to school a while, I reckon.”</p>

<p>And so he did. He also told Davy his adventures.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
He had been assistant wagon master with Buck Bomer
from Leavenworth northwest to Fort Laramie, and
from Laramie south sixty miles to new Fort Walbach.
After that he had gone trapping, but hadn’t caught
much. In December he had started home mule-back
with two other “men.” The Indians had chased them
in central Kansas, and they had tried to sleep in a
cave until they found that it was strewn with skeletons;
and a snowstorm had buffeted them, but at last
they had reached Leavenworth.</p>

<p>This seemed considerable for a boy of fourteen to
have done. Billy brought home his wages, as usual,
for his mother, and now he settled down to school
again. Davy was very glad to have him back.</p>

<p>Once in a while he and Billy rode into Leavenworth
on errands. As the winter wore away rumors of
the Pike’s Peak region and the Cherry Creek gold
diggings in it grew more and more numerous. A few
travellers from that western border of Kansas (for
Kansas Territory extended clear to the Rocky Mountains)
arrived in Leavenworth and declared that things
out in the Pike’s Peak region were booming. Two
towns, Auraria and Denver, had been founded on
Cherry Creek; and from the sands gold was being
washed out. It was claimed that the mines would equal
those of California—and they were much nearer to
the States.</p>

<p>Soon after Billy had come home he and Davy met<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
Mr. Baxter on the street in Leavenworth. Mr. Baxter
looked fine, and shook hands heartily with them.</p>

<p>“What are you doing for yourselves?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Going to school. What are you doing?”</p>

<p>“Oh, visiting ’round, waiting for the trail to open.”</p>

<p>“The green grass will sure look good,” quoth Billy,
wisely. “What are you going to do, Reverend? Bull
whack?”</p>

<p>“No. I think I’ll strike out for the new Cherry
Creek diggings.”</p>

<p>“Thought you didn’t count much on those stories,”
reminded Davy.</p>

<p>“I didn’t, but I do now. Just got back from
Omaha. Boys, I saw six quills full of gold there from
the Pike’s Peak country. Everybody up at Omaha is
wild about it. They’re all going. The newspapers
from my home town in Massachusetts are full of gold
stories. The whole East is excited. By spring you’ll
see the biggest crowd starting on the Overland Trail
since the days of Forty-nine and the California boom.
Leavenworth won’t be big enough to hold the people
outfitting here.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah for Cherry Creek, then!” cried Billy.
“Reckon we’ll have to go, Davy!”</p>

<p>“I’ll go,” agreed Davy eagerly.</p>

<p>“We’ll all go,” said Mr. Baxter. “Everybody’ll
go.”</p>

<p>A lean, sallow, unshaven man in jeans and flannel
shirt and boots and a huge muffler around his neck and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
a round fur cap on his head had been standing near.
He nodded.</p>

<p>“Right you are, pards,” he put in. “That’s the
place.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?” queried Billy, quickly.</p>

<p>“I’ve been thar, an’ now I’ve come back to tell my
friends. Why, boys, out thar all you’ve got to do is
to pull up the grass by the roots an’ shake out the gold.
Pike’s Peak is solid gold, ’most. A feller can make a
flat-bottom boat an’ set knives in the hull an’ slide
down, scraping up the gold in slivers.”</p>

<p>“Did you ever see that done?” demanded Mr.
Baxter.</p>

<p>“Not exac’ly, stranger. But I’m goin’ to do it.”</p>

<p>That sounded like a tall story—although of course
it <em>might</em> be true. Billy and Mr. Baxter put small stock
in the tale; but it filled Davy’s mind with delightful
visions. He dreamed of taking a plough up Pike’s
Peak and ploughing golden furrows clear to the
bottom.</p>

<p>Suddenly Salt Creek Valley and all the frontier
along the Missouri River from St. Louis up to Omaha
was excited. The Leavenworth papers printed wonderful
stories of the new gold fields, where miners were
washing out the precious metal. The Georgia party
of miners, some of whom were Cherokee Indians,
which had outfitted at Leavenworth last fall and had
gone out by the southwest Santa Fe Trail to the mountains
and thence north to Cherry Creek, had “struck it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
rich,” and had sent back the quills of gold to prove it.
Already emigrants from the East were arriving in
Leavenworth, wild to push on as soon as the spring
opened. Between themselves Billy and Dave determined
to join the crowd. It was all they could do to
wait.</p>

<p>One day early in March Davy was making a brief
call at the Cody house, when Billy excitedly pointed
from the front porch.</p>

<p>“There’s the first one!” he cried. “There’s the
first prairie schooner bound for the diggings! Let’s
go down and meet it!”</p>

<p>Away he rushed; Davy followed, and so did the
girls. Mrs. Cody stood shading her eyes, watching.
Across the valley crept a white-topped wagon drawn
by two yoke of oxen. Beside the wagon was trudging
a man, and behind followed another man pushing a
two-wheeled cart. When Billy and Dave met the outfit
they saw that two women were in the big wagon;
one held a baby; on the other side of the wagon were
sturdily trudging a boy and girl. A big shaggy dog
barked at Turk, and Turk growled back.</p>

<p>The wagon was a farm wagon covered with the
cotton hood and stuffed with household goods. On
the sides the hood bore, in scrawly black paint:
“PIKE’S PEAK OR BUST.”</p>

<p>“Hello!” hailed Billy. “Where you bound?”</p>

<p>“To the new diggin’s, stranger,” responded the
driver of the oxen. “See our sign?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span></p>

<p>“Do you live hyar’bouts?” asked the man who
was pushing the hand-cart—which also was loaded
with household stuff and camp stuff. The ox-team
paused; the man pushing the hand-cart wiped his forehead
with a red handkerchief.</p>

<p>“Yes; we live up yonder near the top of the hill.”</p>

<p>“How long do you reckon it’ll take us to get to
Cherry Creek?” pursued the ox-team driver.</p>

<p>“Two months if you keep going,” said Billy.</p>

<p>“’Twon’t take as long as that, stranger,” replied
the man. “We can travel right smart.”</p>

<p>“They do say you can dig out the gold with a
shovel,” quavered the woman. “We hear tell you can
dig out a pound a day. Were you ever there?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Billy. “But we’re going. Aren’t
you a little early?”</p>

<p>“Wall, we reckoned we’d start ’arly, an’ make our
pile ’fore the other folks got thar,” explained the
driver. “Thar’s a tarnel lot o’ people gathered behind
us, an’ those that come later won’t find ’nough grass for
their critters. Gee-up, Buck! Spot! Get along with
you.”</p>

<p>Creaking, the wagon resumed its way. The man
with the hand-cart pushed in the wake. The mud was
ankle deep, and Dave felt sorry for the whole outfit.</p>

<p>“Better stop on the hill and rest,” bade Billy.
“Guess we can give you some coffee.”</p>

<p>“Nope, thank ye, stranger,” said the driver.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
“We’re goin’ on through.” And he swung his whip,
urging his oxen.</p>

<p>Billy and Dave and the girls raced ahead; and
when the wagon and the hand-cart, with the oxen and
men alike panting, toiled up hill near the Cody house
Mrs. Cody rushed out with a pail of hot coffee. But
the emigrants scarcely halted to drink it. Even the
women were anxious to proceed, as if already they saw
the gold.</p>

<p>“Poor things,” sighed Mrs. Cody, while the girls
waved goodby to the two children. “They’ll have a
hard time.”</p>

<p>But Billy and Dave watched until the “Pike’s
Peak or Bust” sign was only a blur, and the wagon a
crawling dot.</p>

<p>“Shucks!” said Billy. “If it wasn’t for mother
and school I’d join ’em. But I wouldn’t go by the
regular Overland Trail. When we go we’ll take the
Smoky Hill trail, Dave; up the Kansas River, to Fort
Riley, and on out by the Smoky Hill branch or the
Republican. That’s shorter.”</p>

<p>This “Pike’s Peak or Bust” outfit was only the
first of a long series of gold-field “pilgrims” (as they
were called), all enthusiastic. And soon Leavenworth
City was a sight! As Mr. Baxter had predicted, the
city was scarcely large enough to hold the new-comers.
Two and three steamboats a day arrived, loaded to the
gunwales, at the levee, bringing up from St. Louis and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
Kansas City Eastern and Southern people, their teams
and goods.</p>

<p>The streets were thronged with the strangers, young
and old, in all kinds of costumes and of all professions—farmers,
lawyers, ministers, doctors, merchants,
teachers—buying supplies and exchanging opinions.
The lodging houses and hotels and spare rooms were
overflowing, and around the city and in the vacant lots
were hundreds of tents, where were camped overland
parties of men and whole families.</p>

<p>A constant procession of “pilgrims” wended slow
way through the Salt Creek Valley, past the Cody
home and the Shields home, and northwestward to the
main Salt Lake Overland Trail which led up the Platte
River; at the South Platte they might branch for the
“diggin’s” by a cut-off. Many of the wagon hoods
bore that queer legend “Pike’s Peak or Bust!” Some
men trundled wheel-barrows, loaded, and a few were
trying to carry packs through on their backs.</p>

<p>But the greatest procession went out over the new
route from Leavenworth southwest to the Kansas
River; thence on to Fort Riley at the forks, and either
northwest up the Republican branch or west up the
Smoky Hill River branch. Still other people travelled
by the Santa Fe Trail—the southernmost trail of all—up
the Arkansas River to the mountains, and then
north along the base of the mountains past Pike’s Peak
itself to Cherry Creek and Denver.</p>

<p>Mr. Russell, of Russell, Majors &amp; Waddell, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
Mr. John S. Jones put in a stage line to Denver by the
Smoky Hill route. It was called the “Leavenworth &amp;
Pike’s Peak Express Company,” Jones &amp; Russell, Proprietors.
Two stages, travelling together for protection
against the Indians, each drawn by four fine Kentucky
mules and carrying six passengers, left Leavenworth
every morning for Denver, and covered the 700 rolling
miles in ten days. Soon the return stages would
be arriving, and everybody was expecting great news.
It was calculated that already 25,000 people had started
for the diggings. The trails were said to be white with
the wagons and the camps.</p>

<p>The streets and the levee of Leavenworth were so
full of fascinating sights that Davy took every moment
he could spare from chores and school to go in with
Billy and look and listen. The best place was in front
of the Planters’ House Hotel, across the street from
the office of Russell, Majors &amp; Waddell. Here the
stages started, and here people gathered to bid one
another goodby. The conversation was most interesting,
as people on the ground called up to passengers
in the stages.</p>

<p>“Send us back a sack of gold, John.”</p>

<p>“Hold tight to your scalps, boys.”</p>

<p>“Let us know how things are. Be sure and write.”</p>

<p>“Kill a buffalo for me, Frank. I want a good big
hide, remember.”</p>

<p>“Leave a message for me on the top of Pike’s
Peak.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span></p>

<p>“Look out for the ‘Rapahoes.’”</p>

<p>“Goodby, goodby, old fellow.”</p>

<p>“Don’t forget to give Robinson that package from
his wife.”</p>

<p>“Most of these people don’t know where they’re
going or why,” remarked a man near Davy, to another
man. “There’ll be much suffering from this mad
rush.”</p>

<p>He was a tall, slender, erect man of about thirty-five,
with long bronzed, florid face, sandy complexion
and crisp, sandy beard.</p>

<p>“That’s Lieutenant William T. Sherman, formerly
of the Army. He’s practising law here now with Judge
Ewing,” said another man, aside, to a companion. In
a few more years he would be the famous “General
Sherman.”</p>

<p>Billy Cody, too, was of the opinion that the green-horns
on the trail would meet with trouble; and in
Davy’s opinion Billy ought to know. Already reports
were to the effect that the route up the Smoky Hill and
the Republican were short of grass and exposed to the
Indians, and that the emigrants were being compelled
to throw away much of their baggage.</p>

<p>However, this did not stop anybody from starting.
Davy and Billy had the gold fever bad. Even Mr.
Shields had decided to take his wife and baby and leave
the ranch for the diggings, where he counted on making
more money in a week than he could make here in a
year. So Davy only waited on Billy, to start, himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span></p>

<p>“Shucks!” exclaimed Billy, in May. “I’ve got to
quit, Dave, and go on the trail again. Mother said
last night ‘All right.’ She’ll let me go. She needs the
money and I’ll send her back a lot. Come on. We’ll
raise a gang and start.”</p>

<p>“When, Billy?”</p>

<p>“Right away, as soon as we get the men and the
outfit. This green grass makes me restless. Got any
money left, Dave? We have to buy a wagon and
team.”</p>

<p>Yes, Davy had almost all his herding wages on deposit
with Mr. Majors. He was proud to say so, and
to be able to pay his own way.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="IX">IX<br />
<small>THE HEE-HAW EXPRESS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Now Billy wasted no time with the preparations.
That was his style. The Reverend Mr. Baxter, who
had been ill in Leavenworth, and so had not started
before, promptly agreed to join the party. He and
Billy and Dave clubbed together with an outfit that
Billy knew. These were Jim Barber and Hi Wilson
and another man called “Left-over Joe.” Jim and Hi
had been teamsters with Russell, Majors &amp; Waddell
bull trains; but “Left-over Joe” seemed to be nobody
in particular—and that is why they nicknamed him
“Left-over Joe.”</p>

<p>A big emigrant outfitting camp had been established
in the Salt Creek Valley near the Cody home,
and while Jim and Hi were here getting ready to move
on, this lean, lank, very long-necked hobbledehoy of
squeaky voice and nineteen or twenty years had wandered
into their camp and adopted them. So they let
him stay.</p>

<p>Jim and Hi had a team of mules: Billy and Dave
and Mr. Baxter added an old light wagon. The party
thought themselves lucky, for oxen had risen in price<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
to $175 and $200 a yoke, and mules and horses were
scarcer yet. Wagons were scarce, too.</p>

<p>By the time that the supplies of salty pork and beans
and flour and coffee had been laid in for “grub,” and
picks and spades and gold-pans for digging out the
gold and separating it, and ammunition for killing
game and fighting Indians, Davy’s money was about
gone. However, that did not matter. They all would
find gold enough to last them the rest of their lives!</p>

<p>Billy owned the Mississippi “yager” smoothbore
musket and the two Colt’s navy revolvers that he had
used when in the mule fort. He gave Davy one of the
revolvers. With it belted at his waist, Davy felt like a
regular scout indeed. Hi and Jim also owned guns.
Hi’s was a yager similar to Billy’s. Jim’s was a heavy
Sharp’s “Old Reliable” rifle, of fifty calibre holding
six cartridges underneath, and one in the breech. It
was a tremendously hard-shooting gun. Whoever had
a Sharp’s “Old Reliable” had the best gun on the
plains.</p>

<p>The Reverend Mr. Baxter had no gun at all and did
not want one, he claimed. “Left-over Joe” had no
gun at all, but wanted one badly. Hi promised to let
him shoot the yager sometime.</p>

<p>The Salt Creek camp was a lively place. Here
were assembled a thousand emigrants, all “Pike’s
Peakers,” making ready to travel on westward and find
their fortunes. About every kind of an outfit was to be
seen, and all sorts of people. Many of the men never<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
had driven oxen or mules before; they had bought
what they could get; some of the animals proved not
to be broken to drive, and when the green-horns tried
to hitch up the green “critters” then there was fun for
the onlookers.</p>

<p>However, nobody was delaying to watch the
“fun.” By the hundred, parties were setting out every
day from the camp as well as from Leavenworth.
Thousands of gold-seekers already had left Omaha
and Kansas City and St. Joseph. It was reported that
along any of the trails a person could walk from the
Missouri River to the Rocky Mountains on the tops
of the prairie schooners—so thick was the travel. It
beat the celebrated stampede to California in 1849.</p>

<p>There were four trails to the “diggin’s.” The two
best known were the Santa Fe Trail, on the south,
which followed up the Arkansas River in southern
Kansas, to the mountains, and then turned north for
the gold fields; and the big Salt Lake Overland Trail,
on the north, which from the Missouri River followed
up the Platte River, until in western Nebraska the gold
hunters turned south for Pike’s Peak. Omaha and St.
Joseph were the outfitting points for this northern
trail, and Leavenworth traffic struck it by the government
road which ran through Salt Creek Valley on
into the northwest. The Russell, Majors &amp; Waddell
“bull trains” hauled their freight over this route.</p>

<p>The other two trails were new central trails, made
especially for the Pike’s Peak rush. One trail followed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
up the Republican River through southern
Nebraska; the other followed up along the Smoky Hill
Fork River, through central Kansas. Emigrants
coming in by St. Joseph were taking either the Salt
Lake and California Overland route or the Republican
route; the emigrants outfitting at Leavenworth and the
Salt Creek Valley were taking the Smoky Hill route
or else the Overland Trail route.</p>

<p>By the Overland Trail (the Salt Lake and California
Trail) it was accounted 580 miles from Omaha
to the diggin’s; and the Pike’s Peak Guide-book recommended
that trail. But from Leavenworth it was 100
miles further, and the Smoky Hill Trail was said to be
the straightest and the shortest. The Leavenworth &amp;
Pike’s Peak Express Company stages had chosen that
route.</p>

<p>“I reckon that’s the route for us,” said Hi. “I
hear we can follow the Smoky clear to the mountains,
and have water all the way.”</p>

<p>“When the first stage comes back we’ll know more
about it, but we can’t wait,” mused the Reverend Mr.
Baxter.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll get through,” spoke Billy, quickly.
“And the sooner we start the better, before all the
grass and fuel are used up. Look at the people, will
you, pulling out every day!”</p>

<p>“Do you think one wagon will be enough to bring
back our gold?” squeaked Left-over, anxiously. “I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
don’t want to quit till I get a million dollars’ worth for
myself alone.”</p>

<p>“Then what’ll you do, Left-over?” asked Jim, with
a wink at the rest.</p>

<p>Left-over Joe scratched his long freckled neck and
looked like a chicken.</p>

<p>“I’d buy a gun and have all the pie I wanted, too,”
he declared foolishly.</p>

<p>Now everything had been made ready. The night
before the start Billy and Dave spent in camp with
the rest of the party. Mr. Shields and family had gone;
their log cabin was empty, their claim abandoned again.
If they had stayed they could have made lots of money
selling produce to the emigrants; but they, like the
thousands of others, wished to get rich quick.</p>

<p>This last evening in the Salt Creek emigrant camp
the party elected their officers. Hi was chosen captain
or wagon-master, Billy was chosen lieutenant or assistant,
Mr. Baxter volunteered to cook, and “Left-over”
was appointed “cavarango” or herder of the two
mules. This left Jim and Davy for the general work
of march and camp.</p>

<p>With the provisions and bedding and mining tools
and other stuff the wagon was well loaded for two
mules to haul across the plains; so it was decided that
all the party except the driver must walk. They would
take turns driving and riding; and after the mules
were well broken in and the trail was rougher then
probably nobody would ride.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span></p>

<p>“I reckon we ought to make twenty miles a day,
with mules,” quoth Billy, wisely. “But those oxen the
other folks are using won’t make more than twelve or
fifteen miles a day. Some of ’em are liable to be sixty
days on the road.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll be lucky if we get through in thirty,”
said Mr. Baxter. “It will be nearer forty.”</p>

<p>“Do we have to walk forty days?” squealed “Left-over.”</p>

<p>“That’s nothing to a bull whacker,” said Hi,
gruffly. “I’ve walked clean from Leavenworth to
Salt Lake and back again.”</p>

<p>“So have I,” nodded Jim. “That’s twelve hundred
miles each way—and most of it up-hill, too!”</p>

<p>The Smoky Hill Fork trail was to be struck at
Fort Riley, 132 miles southwest from Leavenworth.
Here the Smoky Hill Fork and the Republican Rivers
joined to form the Kaw or Kansas River. Settlements
extended to Fort Riley and a short distance
beyond; but after that the country was the “Indian
Country.”</p>

<p>“Lookee here,” suddenly exclaimed Billy Cody, that
last night before the start, when everybody was under
blankets and almost asleep. “We’ve got to have a
name painted on our wagon.”</p>

<p>“Can’t we travel anonymous?” queried the Reverend
Mr. Baxter, sleepily.</p>

<p>“I dunno what that means but it sounds pretty
good,” spoke Hi. “Can you spell it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span></p>

<p>“Oh,” chuckled Mr. Baxter, “that doesn’t mean
anything.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” grumbled Hi. “I thought it was an animile
like a hippopotamus, mebbe.”</p>

<p>When the camp turned out at sunrise Billy had already
been up, and on the wagon hood he had painted,
with the stick and tar-pot used for greasing the wagon,
the title: “HEE-HAW EXPRESS.” So, amidst
laughter, the Hee-Haw Express it was which, soon
after sun-up, joined the procession that, anew each
day, filed out for the long trail to Pike’s Peak.</p>

<p>The Hee-Haw Express, being mule-power, travelled
faster than many of the other outfits. The road
certainly presented a series of strange sights, as if
everybody had thrown together whatever he could
and was hastening from a fire or a plague. The Hee-Haw
Express, at amble and fast walk, with Hi driving
and his partners trudging as fast as they were able
beside, gradually passed men with packs, men pushing
handcarts and wheel-barrows, crippled ox teams, next
an ox and a cow harnessed together, next a mule and
an ox harnessed together; and so forth and so forth,
all in the dust and the shouting and the rumbling and
creaking and whip cracking.</p>

<p>Almost all the other “Pike’s Peak pilgrims” passed
by the Hee-Haw Express waved and shouted their
greetings.</p>

<p>“Trade you my wheel-barrow for a mule.”</p>

<p>“You must be in a rush, strangers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span></p>

<p>“What’s the fare?”</p>

<p>To this Billy answered gaily:</p>

<p>“Regular stage rates. Twenty-five cents a mile or
hundred dollars to the mountains.”</p>

<p>For that was what the Leavenworth &amp; Pike’s Peak
Express Company charged.</p>

<p>Many of the other wagons also bore signs. “Pike’s
Peak or Bust!” “Noah’s Ark!” “Root Hog or
Die!” “Pike’s Peak Special!” “Bound For the
Diggin’s!”—thus ran some of the lines to be noted as
the Hee-Haw Express sturdily pressed forward.</p>

<p>That night the road was one continuous camp, with
fires glowing and canvas glimmering as far as the eye
could see in either direction. Parties visited back and
forth, men and women exchanged news and views,
children played in the firelight shadows, babies cried,
dogs barked, and not until after nine o’clock was the
trail quiet enough so that nervous persons might sleep.
However, Davy was not nervous; and from the snores
he might judge that Billy and the rest were not nervous
either.</p>

<p>The next day the Hee-Haw Express started early,
and was on the road even before sun-up. Billy and
Hi and all were anxious to pass Fort Riley and strike
the Smoky Hill Fork as soon as possible, and in advance
of as many of these “pilgrims” as possible.
The only excitement of this day was a sudden cheer
adown the line and a craning of necks and waving of
hands. Before, from the west, were approaching two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
vehicles—by the looks of them, and by the four mules,
stages, both!</p>

<p>And two stages they proved to be, as, skirting the
procession of “pilgrims,” they dashed along, bound
for Leavenworth. The first bore a lot of bright bunting
and streamers, and on its sides a banner that said:
“Greetings from the Gold Mountains of Kansas.”
By its dusty appearance and the appearance of its
driver and passengers, this coach evidently had come
clear from Pike’s Peak. The second coach, close following,
was its escort from Fort Riley in to Leavenworth.</p>

<p>Speedily the word travelled through the column of
Pike’s Peakers that the first coach actually was the first
return coach from the gold mines, and that it carried
to Leavenworth $3500 in gold dust. Leavenworth, as
was afterwards reported, had a big celebration.</p>

<p>Of course, the sight of the travel-stained coach,
and the rumors as to what it contained and what news
it bore, excited the emigrants. Some of them began
to throw away stuff in order to lighten their loads; so
that from here on to Fort Riley the trail was strewn
with what Billy called “useless plunder.” But the
Hee-Haw party were experienced enough to start out
only with what they needed, and they had nothing to
throw away yet.</p>

<p>The last of the settlements was Junction City, just
beyond Fort Riley. While the rest of the party were
making camp along with the other “pilgrims,” outside<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
the little town, Billy and Dave rode the mules in to see
if there were any provisions worth buying. Mr.
Baxter, the cook, said that if they could find any dried
apples he would make a pie!</p>

<p>But there were no dried apples or any other such
delicacies in rude little Junction City, here at the edge
of the Indian country. Every store seemed to be a
saloon; and the streets were thronged with rough emigrants
and soldiers from the fort. Only whom did the
boys meet but Wild Bill Hickok!</p>

<p>He was standing on the edge of the plank sidewalk
of the one business street, with several other men, apparently
expecting something.</p>

<p>“Why, hello, Bill!”</p>

<p>“Hello, Billy. How are you, Dave? Where’d
you come from, if I may ask?”</p>

<p>“Salt Creek,” answered Billy Cody.</p>

<p>“Going to Pike’s Peak,” announced Davy.</p>

<p>“Good enough,” approved Wild Bill. “People are
taking a little gold out o’ thar, that’s sure. But I
don’t believe all I hear.”</p>

<p>“What are you doing here, Bill?”</p>

<p>“I? Well, I may go to the diggin’s myself, and
I may drive stage. To-day’s stage westbound is due
now. That’s what we’re looking for.”</p>

<p>“She’s a comin’,” remarked one of the other men,
with a nod.</p>

<p>Sure enough, up the trail from the east, along the
north bank of the Smoky Hill Fork, in the dusk and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
dust came at a gallop the Leavenworth stage for the
Pike’s Peak country, drawn by its four fine mules. It
halted before the Junction House Hotel, and the passengers
clambered stiffly out from under the canvas
top that arched over the wagon box.</p>

<p>They were only two, and one from the driver’s
box. The two plainly enough were Easterners. The
first was a rather young man, with a thin sandy beard
and a soft slouch hat; the second was a stoutish, elderly
man, with a round rosy face and a fringe of white
whiskers under his chin. He wore a rather dingy
whitish coat; the younger man wore a regulation
duster. They both gazed about them alertly before
entering the hotel.</p>

<p>“Hello, Bill,” nodded the stage driver, descending,
after tossing his lines to the hostler from the stage
stable—for Junction City was Station Number Seven
on the stage route.</p>

<p>“Who’s yore load, Tom?” queried somebody.</p>

<p>“That old fellow in the white coat, he’s Horace
Greeley. Other fellow’s named Richardson—Albert
D. Richardson.”</p>

<p>“Where they from?”</p>

<p>“N’ York, I reckon.”</p>

<p>“Where they going?”</p>

<p>“Out to the diggin’s.”</p>

<p>“What line they in?”</p>

<p>“Newspaper fellows of some sort, I hear tell. Anyhow,
they ask a heap of questions. That old chap in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
the white coat he’s been speech-makin’ all through
Kansas. As I understand it, he an’ that young fellow
are goin’ out to the mines to write up the country, so
the people of the East’ll know what’s true an’ what
ain’t.” And Tom the driver walked on into the hotel
to wash and eat.</p>

<p>“Seems to me I’ve heard of Horace Greeley,”
mused Wild Bill. “He’s quite a man.”</p>

<p>“Sure. He’s editor of the New York <cite>Tribune</cite>,”
asserted a man who had not spoken before. “He’s
the biggest man on the biggest paper in the States,
and what he says will influence the people more than
a stage-load of gold. Richardson’s a newspaper man,
too; and another reporter, named Henry Villard, of
Cincinnati, is out at the diggin’s now. But Greeley’s
the biggest of the lot. They say only one printer in
his office can read his writing; but the old man has
come out here to get the truth, and if he tells the people
to ‘go West’ they’ll go.”</p>

<p>“That,” quoth Wild Bill emphatically, “is the best
thing that’s ever happened to this country. But it seems
to me it’s a lot of trouble for a man to take. Do you
reckon he’s going to start a paper out thar at Cherry
Creek?”</p>

<p>“No, sir! They say Horace Greeley is wedded to
two things: his New York <cite>Tribune</cite> and his old white
coat.”</p>

<p>“Well, if he makes any speech here to-night I’m
going to hear him,” said Wild Bill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span></p>

<p>Horace Greeley did make a speech to citizens and
emigrants, in a partly-finished stone church. He talked
on “Republicanism.” But Dave and Billy and Hi
and Jim and “Left-over” were too tired to go and
hear him; and so were the majority of the “pilgrims.”
The Reverend Mr. Baxter went in and reported that
it was very good for those who agreed with it.</p>

<p>Bearing Horace Greeley and Journalist Richardson,
the stage continued westward in the morning. So did
the Hee-Haw Express.</p>

<small>“PIKE’S PEAK OR BUST!”</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Already the procession had considerably thinned
out. Some of the outfits had broken down and some
had quit discouraged. The Pike’s Peak region was
still 500 miles distant, and the worst of the journey lay
before. However, the Hee-Haw Express had no
thought of quitting.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to travel under discipline from now
on, boys,” spoke Captain Hi at noon camp. “You
bear in mind I’m boss, and Billy is second boss. We’ll
try to be as easy on you as we can, but what we say
goes. The only person who doesn’t need to pay much
attention is the cook. He’s his own boss. The rest of
us will mount guard every night and follow a regular
schedule. I appoint Jim the official hunter, because
he’s got the best gun. Jim, you watch out for meat.
Ought to see buffalo, plenty.” And Jim nodded.
“Davy, you’re assistant to the cook. You get him
fuel and water.” And Davy nodded. “Left-over and
Billy and I’ll tend to the mules.”</p>

<p>“What I want to know is, why don’t we ever have
pie. If I’d thought we’d eat just bacon and beans and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
coffee all the way across to the mountains I wouldn’t
have come,” squeaked Left-over, earnestly.</p>

<p>“Sowbelly and beans will make a man of you,”
growled Hi. “After you’ve stood a steady diet of
that for a couple o’ months nothing can kill yuh.”
And he rose. “All right; catch up, boys. Let’s be
moving.”</p>

<p>“Catch up” (or “Ketch up,” as Hi pronounced
it) was the regulation signal in the freighters’ trains
on the plains for harnessing the mules and oxen to the
wagons. So now the span of mules were put back
into their places on either side of the tongue, and
Left-over climbed into the seat; it was his turn to
drive.</p>

<p>Just before sunset Left-over, peering ahead from
his driver’s seat, uttered a shrill whoop and tried to
whip up his mules.</p>

<p>“Hyar! What’re you aiming to do?” demanded
Captain Hi, severely.</p>

<p>“Aw, can’t you let a feller be?” whined Left-over.
“I was going on ahead, is all, and see what I could
buy.”</p>

<p>On a little hillock, before, beside the trail was what
appeared to be another stage station of canvas, but the
top of the tent (for wall tent it turned out to be) displayed
in large black letters the sign: “Grocery.”
This explained Left-over’s hurry. However, as the
nearest “pilgrims” were behind he would have the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
grocery to himself, so Captain Hi calmed him down
with—</p>

<p>“Don’t be so brash about it, then. If you go and
kill off one of those mules we’ll put you in harness
with the other one.”</p>

<p>“And that will be a pair,” added Billy, quick as a
wink.</p>

<p>“Never mind, Left-over,” comforted the Reverend.
“Maybe we can get our dried apples there
and have that pie I promised you.”</p>

<p>But as they toiled on nearer, the tent grocery
seemed deserted. It had no customers and no proprietor.</p>

<p>“Whoa!” yelled Left-over loudly, pulling down
his mules opposite the tent. “Whoa, there!” And—“Hello,”
he hailed shrilly.</p>

<p>At this slowly emerged from between two large
barrels the figure of a gaunt, frowsy-headed man—like
a dog crawling out of a kennel. The man must
have been asleep. He yawned and stretched and
stared.</p>

<p>“Howdy?”</p>

<p>“Howdy, strangers.”</p>

<p>“What do you keep?”</p>

<p>“Everything.”</p>

<p>“Got any dried apples?” demanded Left-over,
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Nary apple.”</p>

<p>“Got any crackers?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span></p>

<p>“Nary cracker.”</p>

<p>“Any ham?” queried Hi.</p>

<p>“Nary ham.”</p>

<p>“Any molasses?” asked Billy.</p>

<p>“Nary molasses.”</p>

<p>“Any salt?” asked Jim.</p>

<p>“Nary salt.”</p>

<p>“What have you got, then?”</p>

<p>“Pickles and smokin’ tobacco, strangers. Which’ll
you have?”</p>

<p>“That’s a great grocery stock!” scoffed Billy, as
the Hee-Haw party proceeded. “Pickles and smoking
tobacco!”</p>

<p>“I should say!” agreed Davy. “Not much
chance for a pie there!”</p>

<p>“I didn’t s’pose the country was going to be as bad
as this,” whined Left-over, from the wagon seat.</p>

<p>“Wait till you strike the wust of it,” answered
Jim.</p>

<p>“Somebody’s broken down ahead, hasn’t he?”
queried the Reverend Mr. Baxter.</p>

<p>“Looks so. We’ll go on and make camp there,
anyway, and see,” directed Captain Hi.</p>

<p>The trail had veered apart from the Smoky Hill
Fork and was cutting through a wide, flat bottom-land,
grown to short buffalo grass and a few cottonwood
trees. In the midst of the stretch was a “prairie
schooner,” halted, its white hood just visible in the
gathering dusk. Lonely enough it looked, too—solitary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
there with not another token of human life near
it. It did not have even a camp-fire.</p>

<p>In the twilight the Hee-Haw Express drew upon
it and halted also. The owner of the wagon was sitting
on the tongue, smoking an old clay pipe.</p>

<p>“Howdy, strangers?” he greeted, coolly.</p>

<p>“Howdy,” they responded; and suddenly Billy
nudged Davy and pointed to the wagon hood.</p>

<p>“Pike’s Peak or Bust!” said the one sign; and
under that had been added: “Busted, by Thunder!”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, pardner? Stuck?” asked
Captain Hi.</p>

<p>The man jerked his thumb toward the wagon hood.</p>

<p>“Read for yoreself, stranger,” he bade.
“Busted!”</p>

<p>“Where’s your party?”</p>

<p>“I’m the party. I sent the old woman and the
kids back by stage, and I air hyar and hyar I stay, I
reckon.”</p>

<p>“Where are your animals?”</p>

<p>“My critters war a hoss and a caow, hitched together.
Injuns stole my hoss; the old caow’s had a
calf daown in the willows; and I’m busted. How far
to Pike’s Peak yet?”</p>

<p>“’Bout five hundred miles.”</p>

<p>“Wall,” drawled the man, yawning, “in case my
old woman doesn’t find another outfit back at the
Missouri I reckon I can wait till the calf grows up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span></p>

<p>“Nothing we can do for you?” invited Mr.
Baxter.</p>

<p>The man slowly shook his head.</p>

<p>“Nope, stranger. I air comfortable. ’Bout two
miles on you’ll find a better campin’ place. Water and
fuel right around hyar I’m goin’ to need, myself.”</p>

<p>So, thus politely dismissed, the Hee-Haw Express
moved along until, where the trail crossed a creek,
they found the wood and water.</p>

<p>The trail stretched ever on and on. For one only
six or eight weeks old it was remarkable. Hundreds
of wagons and animals had worn it wide and plain;
and, moreover, on either side of it were scattered
cook-stoves, trunks, bedsteads, bureaus, and other
bulky household stuff, cast overboard to relieve the
tiring teams. Davy found a rag doll and Billy picked
up a thick hank of false hair. As Jim remarked: “A
fellow could follow this trail in the dark by stubbing
his toes!”</p>

<p>“Busted” outfits were constantly passed. The
strain of the wild march to “Pike’s Peak” was taking
its toll of the weak and the illy prepared.</p>

<p>The stage stations were placed from ten to twenty
miles apart. They had been located in a hurry;
wagons sent out from Leavenworth by Jones &amp; Russell
had dropped off the station agents and their outfits
as fast as possible all the way through to Denver.
Some of the stations were merely pieces of canvas
laid over pole frames; and some were caves in clay<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
banks of streams; but under the canvas and in the
caves were living not only men but their wives.</p>

<p>However, the fact that the stations had been established
at all in such a rush across 600 miles of uninhabited
country struck Davy as no small feat. And
every day, on this Smoky Hill route trail, a stage coming
from the west was met, and another coming from
the east passed them. The stages went galloping along
hauled by four dusty mules. The report was that the
company had spent three hundred thousand dollars
before the first coach had been started, and that the
expenses were eight hundred dollars a day! The fare
from Leavenworth to Denver was $100.</p>

<p>The sight of the two stages each day was quite an
event to the toiling Pike’s Peak Pilgrims, and they
levelled all kinds of questions at driver and passengers
whenever they had a chance.</p>

<p>The trail did not cling to the Smoky Hill Fork, but
frequently was far north of it. Numerous side creeks
were crossed, supplying water and wood; and again
there would be no fuel but the gleaning of buffalo
chips. The country was flattening out into short-grass
plains—buffalo country.</p>

<p>Captain Hi and Lieutenant Billy saw to it that the
span of mules were well attended to at noon and at
evening, and that the daily marches of the Hee-Haw
Express were steady and systematic. So the party
forged straight along. The mules were fast walkers.</p>

<p>“Strangers, you must be in a powerful hurry to dig<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
out that pound of gold a day,” hailed a “Lightning
Express” that the “Hee-Haw” passed.</p>

<p>This Lightning Express was taking a whole sawmill
out—as well as a large family. The household
wagon bore the sign “Lightning Express”; it was
drawn by a mule and an ox, pulling together. Then
followed a freighting wagon loaded with the sawmill,
and drawn by a yoke of oxen and a horse, the
horse being in front of the yoke of oxen. A woman
and several children were trudging beside the covered
wagon. A man afoot drove with his whip.</p>

<p>“Right you are,” replied Captain Hi to the hail.</p>

<p>“Have you heard any news?” quavered the
woman. “Is it true that people are putting knives in
the bottom of their wagon-boxes and sliding down
Pike’s Peak and scraping up the gold in big slivers?”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard about it but I’ve never seen it, ma’am,”
said Hi, truthfully.</p>

<p>“When do we see the mountains?”</p>

<p>“Oh, not for a few hundred miles more,” informed
the Reverend, kindly.</p>

<p>“Well, when you get there and see Jacob Smith
from Posey County, Injianny, tell him we’re coming as
fast as we can,” she called after them.</p>

<p>“We will.”</p>

<p>“Shouldn’t wonder if that was Jacob Smith or
some other pilgrim on his way back already,” proclaimed
Jim, pointing. “Reckon he’s made his pile
and is heading home to spend it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span></p>

<p>“Wish we were doing the same!” squeaked Left-over.
“I’d buy pie; all I could eat.”</p>

<p>“I don’t,” announced Billy Cody. “Do you,
Dave! I want the fun of finding before I have the
fun of spending.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Mr. Baxter; “it’s a heap more fun
to earn what you get.”</p>

<p>A man on horseback was wending way down the
trail from the west. It was an exception to meet anybody
travelling east; he was the first since they had left
the stage line. If he came from the Pike’s Peak country
he ought to bring much news.</p>

<p>So, as he met them, Captain Hi halted the Hee-Haw
Express and hailed him.</p>

<p>“Howdy, stranger? Bound far?”</p>

<p>“To the States if I can get there.”</p>

<p>“Come from far?”</p>

<p>“Far enough, mister. I come from the Cherry
Creek diggin’s.”</p>

<p>Hurrah! Davy had been eyeing him keenly. He
was an unshaven, thin but powerful man, with
cadaverous face and fierce black eyes; and he bestrode
a mule as cadaverous as himself. He carried a musket;
and that seemed to be about all. Anyway, his saddle-bags
were disappointingly flat. But he may have had
his gold stowed out of sight or deposited to his account
somewhere.</p>

<p>“Clear from the diggin’s, eh?” pursued Hi.
“How are things out thar? Booming?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span></p>

<p>The man stroked his black beard and surveyed the
party.</p>

<p>“Do I look booming, mister?” he demanded. “I
wouldn’t give an acre in old Missouri for the whole of
the Pike’s Peak country. You going out yonder after
gold?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Wall, you’re on the hardest trail you ever tackled,
mister; no wood, no water, no forage, and game
mighty scarce. And when you get to the end you won’t
find much. That story about gold is the biggest hoax
ever invented. From now on you’ll meet about as
many people turned back as there are going on.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter? Isn’t there any gold at all?”
asked Billy, dismayed.</p>

<p>“Mighty little and hard to get.”</p>

<p>“I’m going on just the same and see,” said Billy,
doggedly.</p>

<p>“We’re with you, Billy,” encouraged the Reverend.
And—“What’s happening out there, anyway?” he
queried of the returning pilgrim. “We hear that
twenty thousand people are on the road.”</p>

<p>“They’ve made two towns on Cherry Creek; one’s
Auraria, t’other’s called Denver now. They’ve had a
meeting, too, and organized to send a delegate to Congress
from the Territory of Jefferson; and the first
Monday in June they held a convention to form the
State of Jefferson. That was after I left, so I dunno
what you will find when you get there. But you won’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
find gold; at least not to amount to anything. And my
advice is turn around now ’fore you starve to death.”</p>

<p>With that, he clapped his heels against his mule,
and continued. So did the Hee-Haw Express—but in
the opposite direction.</p>

<p>“I reckon,” said Captain Hi, “we’ll keep going.
Little Billy said it.”</p>

<p>That was a great disappointment—to have such a
report. The man seemed to have spoken the truth, for
from now on the returning goldseekers rapidly increased
in numbers, and they all insisted that the Pike’s
Peak country was a hoax, and the trail to it very bad.
Indeed, many “pilgrims” were turning back without
having reached the “diggin’s” at all.</p>

<p>The Hee-Haw party were now well out in the midst
of the Great Plains which stretched from the Missouri
to the Rocky Mountains. Afar extended on either
hand and before and behind, the rolling, sandy surface,
covered with the short, woolly buffalo grass, and
broken here and there by little hills and occasional
willows and cottonwoods growing by the creeks. Jack-rabbits,
as large as fox-terriers, and prairie-dogs and
coyotes and gray wolves and antelope scampered from
the trail, and the paths made by the buffalo frequently
crossed and recrossed.</p>

<p>These paths were worn deep, like bridle paths. Jim
kept the camp in fresh meat from the antelope that he
shot. He stalked them very cleverly, as Dave thought,
by lying out in the brush, and waving his handkerchief<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
from the end of his wiping stick. The flag seemed
to fascinate the curious-minded antelope, who edged
nearer and nearer to him, circling around and around
and peering and stamping, until he shot what he wished,
at his leisure.</p>

<p>The meat was tender and sweet, but according to
Billy and the others, it was nothing compared with
buffalo meat. Buffalo meat gave more strength, and
Billy claimed that anybody could eat it for weeks at a
time and not tire of it. So they all wanted buffalo—and
especially Left-over. He was clamorous to shoot a
buffalo, and began to whine about it continually.</p>

<p>“Lookee here, Left-over,” finally spoke Jim. “If
we let you shoot a buffalo will you quit this etarnel gab
about that and pie?”</p>

<p>“I will. Truly I will, Jim,” promised Left-over.</p>

<p>“All right, then. As soon as we sight buffalo,
where we can get at ’em, you can shoot one, and after
that shut up till we get to Denver.”</p>

<p>“With your gun, Jim?”</p>

<p>“Yes, with my gun.”</p>

<p>Only a few buffalo had been seen thus far. The
“pilgrim” travel on the trail had split their herds
and had made them wary. But on the very next day
it was that Billy, driving the laboring mules, from the
wagon seat whooped exultantly:</p>

<p>“Buffalo! Plenty o’ ’em. There’s yore chance,
Left-over.”</p>

<p>Left-over came running from the rear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span></p>

<p>“Where, Billy?”</p>

<p>“Over there, of course. Don’t you see them?”
and Billy reined in his mules.</p>

<p>“I see ’em! I see ’em!” yelled Left-over, much
excited. “Where’s my gun? Is it loaded? How’ll I
get ’em?”</p>

<p>He would have grabbed the gun from Jim and have
set right out afoot, but Captain Hi and Jim both
stopped him.</p>

<p>“Easy, easy, now!” exclaimed Hi, gazing calculatingly.
“Thar’s buffalo enough for all, I reckon.
Must be two thousand. But if you try to run ’em down
on foot we’ll lose every one. Let’s unharness the
mules, fust.”</p>

<p>Left-over promptly jumped to help. The buffalo
were plain in sight. To the right of the trail, slightly
ahead and just out of gun-shot, they were grazing in a
great herd which speckled the landscape like a mass
of gooseberry bushes.</p>

<p>“Looks as if we had ’em all to ourselves,” quoth
Jim, as the mules were speedily unharnessed from the
wagon. “No ‘pilgrims’ around to interfere with
this herd. Reckon if we don’t get a mess it will be
our own fault.”</p>

<p>“Where do I come in?” whined Left-over, anxiously.
“You promised me, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I did, and I never break a promise. Hyar’s
your gun, now. You stay right whar you are. We’ll<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
drive the buffalo in to you. Otherwise you’ll jest
shoot up the landscape and mebbe yourself or us in
the bargain. Lend me one of your shooting-irons,
Billy. The pistol’s enough. Thanks.”</p>

<p>So saying, he vaulted on one of the mules, Hi did
the same. They rode bareback with the traces tied
short, and used the coiled lines as bridle-reins. Hi
carried his long-barrelled Mississippi yager, Jim held
the Colt’s navy revolver in his right hand. On a wide
circuit they set out, as if to get behind the buffalo and
turn them toward the wagon.</p>

<p>“What are we goin’ to do? Where do we come
in?” wildly appealed Left-over.</p>

<p>“We stay here, I reckon,” said Billy coolly.</p>

<p>“You and Davy and Left-over can whang away,”
bade Mr. Baxter, with a laugh. “I’ll sit in the reserved
seat and see the fun.”</p>

<p>So saying, he calmly clambered aboard and into
the seat, where he stowed himself at languid ease.</p>

<p>“If those mules aren’t broken to buffalo there
won’t be any fun—except for the buffalo,” observed
Billy.</p>

<p>“Yes, Hi and Jim are liable to be stampeded clear
back into Leavenworth,” chuckled Mr. Baxter.</p>

<p>With the four at the wagon keenly watching, Hi
and Jim pursued their circuit. They rode at rapid
gallop, and presently disappeared in a shallow draw.
The next sign of them was the action of the buffalo<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
herd. Animals on the farther outskirts began to lift
their heads and stare and show uneasiness. Gradually
the whole herd were staring in the one direction; and
on a sudden, like a vast blanket tossed by the wind,
forth they lunged into motion. And with reason, for
out into the open, on the far side of them, came racing
hard on their long-eared mules, Hi and Jim.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” cried Billy Cody, exultant. “Those
mules are O. K. Lie low and stay by the wagon,
fellows. Meat’s coming.”</p>

<p>“What’ll I do?” yelled Left-over. “Where’ll I
go?</p>

<p>“You do as I say,” ordered Billy, thoroughly alive.
“Stay right here. We may have to split that herd.”</p>

<p>On blundered the buffalo. The roll of their hoofs
sounded like heavy thunder, and the dust floated over
their dark backs. Pressing valiantly, Hi and Jim
held their mules in the rear, and, still circuiting, forced
the herd over toward the wagon.</p>

<p>“Great Cæsar’s ghost, boys!” gasped Mr. Baxter,
straightening in his seat. “Don’t forget that I’m up
aloft here, and I’ll land hard if that herd strikes us!”</p>

<p>The herd arrived almost before he had finished
speaking. The foremost—a big cow in the lead—went
streaming past just in front of the wagon; and the
whole van of the shaggy, crazy army loomed in one
grand charge on either hand.</p>

<p>“I’ll tend to this side; you and Left-over tend to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
the other,” shouted Billy to Dave. “<a href="#i_fp154">Give it to them!
Split ’em! Split ’em!</a> Wave yore hat, Reverend.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_fp154">
  <img src="images/i_fp154.jpg"  alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><a href="#Page_155">“GIVE IT TO THEM! SPLIT ’EM! SPLIT ’EM!”</a></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>“Now’s your chance, Left-over,” exclaimed Dave,
levelling his revolver.</p>

<p>The Reverend waved his broad hat and shouted
lustily.</p>

<p>“Bang!” spoke Billy’s yager. Davy pointed his
revolver at the nearest buffalo and pulled trigger. He
dimly saw the huge creature plunge forward to its
knees, but he did not wait to see more; he only pulled
trigger as fast as he could right into the faces of the
pelting herd. He had a vague vision of bulging eyes
and lolling red tongues, and short horns and tangled
foreheads and lunging shoulders, and ever the dark,
panting mass flowed past.</p>

<p>Suddenly a tremendous report in his ear well-nigh
deafened him, and Left-over yelped loudly, crying,
“I got him! I got him!”</p>

<p>“Hooray!” screamed the Reverend, choking with
glee, and laughing so that he doubled and swayed.</p>

<p>Left-over was on his back, heels high, gun waving.
He sat up, pulled trigger, and over he went again,
kicked flat by the heavy Sharp’s. At every shot he
yelped, sprawled backward, sat up, shot, and yelped
again.</p>

<p>Davy’s revolver was emptied, and he had space to
watch. Now Left-over’s gun was empty, too; and
dusty and perspiring and wild-eyed, he picked himself
up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span></p>

<p>“How many did I kill?” he squealed hoarsely.
“Are all those mine?”</p>

<p>For the herd had passed, the wagon was untouched,
and the chief token of the battle was the half dozen
bulky forms lying prone almost in the very trail itself.
Davy drew a long breath. That had been an exciting
moment. Hi and Jim came galloping in, their mules
lathered and puffing.</p>

<small>SOME HALTS BY THE WAY</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Good work,” praised Hi, with casual glance.
“Thar are three or four more out yonder. Reckon
we’ve got meat enough now for a while.”</p>

<p>“Which are mine?” squealed Left-over. “Did
you other fellows kill any? I’d have killed fifty if I’d
had any more cartridges.”</p>

<p>“You killed one, all right, Left-over,” asserted
the Reverend. “I saw you. You killed him six times
and once more for luck.”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t, either!” disputed Left-over. “I
killed seven, mebbe more. I shot seven times.”</p>

<p>“Which is it, Reverend?” asked Hi.</p>

<p>The Reverend Mr. Baxter pointed, with a grin;
and grinning, Hi and Jim rode forward to inspect.
Davy went, too; he was certain that a couple of buffalo
had fallen to his revolver, and as there were only
three on this end of the wagon, he did not see where
Left-over’s seven could be.</p>

<p>Hi and Jim were gazing down upon a huge buffalo
bull, who lay with his nose touching the fore wheel of
the wagon. He made a great pool of blood, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
flowed from wounds in his head and his shoulders and
back and legs and everywhere, apparently.</p>

<p>“You certainly peppered him, Left-over,” assured
Hi. “I reckon he’s dead.”</p>

<p>“Did I do all that?” queried Left-over. And he
began to strut. “Well, I think that’s pretty good. If
I hadn’t been here he’d have run right over the wagon.
I picked him out on purpose. But I must have killed
a lot more.” And chattering and strutting he roamed
about, every few seconds returning to examine the
holes that he had made or to thrust the carcass with
his toes or to proclaim how large it was.</p>

<p>“You surely made your mark. Now you can rest
a while,” chuckled Jim. “What’s your count, Billy?”</p>

<p>“Two at my end,” reported Billy, who had shot
and killed, and had reloaded like lightning and shot and
killed again.</p>

<p>“And two for Davy, and another who’s dropped
yonder; and those that Jim and I got. That makes a
mess,” said Hi. “Wall, reckon we’d better butcher
’fore the wolves spoil the meat. You fellows go ahead
here, and Jim and I’ll fetch in the rest.”</p>

<p>“Davy didn’t do so bad, himself; did he?” remarked
Mr. Baxter, climbing out of the wagon. “Did
you aim, Davy?”</p>

<p>“No,” confessed Davy; “not after the first shot.
My eyes were full of buffalo.”</p>

<p>“Mine’s the biggest, anyhow,” boasted Left-over.
“If I hadn’t shot him so much he’d have got away.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span></p>

<p>With Davy and Left-over helping the best that
they could, Billy and the Reverend dressed the buffaloes
that were near the wagon; and before they were
done Hi and Jim came in, packing the best portions
of those lying out in the wake of the herd. Even
though only the best parts—the humps and rib roasts—were
taken, the outfit had what looked to be more meat
than they could use. But Hi and Jim were up to snuff.</p>

<p>“We’ll jerk this as we go,” said Hi. “Cut it into
strips, fellows.”</p>

<p>So they cut much of the meat into strips about two
inches wide and as thick as one’s finger and a foot long,
and hung it on cord all around the wagon, row after
row. So dry was the air and so pure out here in the
great open plains that before the wagon had travelled
an hour the strips already were curing hard and dark.
They resembled strips of leather. That considerable
dust settled on them apparently did no harm.</p>

<p>“Now they’ll keep forever,” declared Hi, striding
along after a brief inspection. “You can chaw ’em
as they are, or fry ’em; and you’ll find ’em the sweetest
meat you ever stuck between your jaws. Thar’s
nothing better than buffalo jerky.”</p>

<p>That afternoon they passed another stalled Pike’s
Peak outfit—a whole family, this time, with their
wagon mired down to the hubs in a boggy place that
sometimes was a creek. The canvas top proclaimed:
“Root Hog or Die! We’re from Ohio. Bound for
the Gold Fields.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span></p>

<p>“Started rooting a leetle early, haven’t you?”
queried Hi, as the Hee-Haw Express halted to survey.</p>

<p>A thin, sallow woman was sitting on the ground
holding a baby. Three children were playing about.
A cookstove stood out, with dishes scattered around.
A yoke of scrawny lame oxen grazed near.</p>

<p>At Hi’s good-natured hail the woman gave a weak,
tired answer.</p>

<p>“Howdy, strangers. Yes, ’pears like we’re stuck.
We’ve been here since yesterday. Can’t seem to get
out.”</p>

<p>“Are you alone?” asked Mr. Baxter.</p>

<p>“No, sir. But my man he’s thar in the wagon,
sick. Reckon he’s got the janders, and he isn’t any
good.”</p>

<p>But a boy younger than Davy walked forward
from the other children. He was a ragged, sharp-faced
youngster, and now full of business.</p>

<p>“I’m boss of this outfit,” he asserted. “Say, can’t
you hitch on your mules an’ give us a lift. Those oxen
of ours can’t pull grass up by the roots, they’re so
plumb wore out. It’s a hard trail, strangers.”</p>

<p>“Sure we can,” replied Hi, promptly. “Unhitch,
boys. Let’s snake ’em out o’ thar.”</p>

<p>“Want our oxen, too?” keenly queried the boy.</p>

<p>“Nope, sonny. We can haul the wagon, but we
can’t haul the bulls at the same time.”</p>

<p>At shout and crack of lash the Hee-Haw mules
sturdily put their shoulders to their collars and with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
heave and groan the wagon rolled out to the firm
ground.</p>

<p>“Much obliged,” said the boy. “What do we owe
you?”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” answered Hi.</p>

<p>“Strangers,” spoke a quavering voice, and the man
himself poked his face out from under the hood,
“how’ll you trade some of that meat for a sack of
flour. I’ve a powerful hankering for fresh meat.”</p>

<p>He was as yellow as a sunflower, and looked pretty
miserable.</p>

<p>“Take ten feet of it and welcome,” proffered Mr.
Baxter at once. “We don’t want your flour.”</p>

<p>“No; we’ve got plenty flour,” added Hi.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said the woman, “but we don’t
travel on charity. My man’s got a turrible hankering
for meat, and if you’ll trade we’ll be right glad to
dicker with you. I reckon you can use the flour, can’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Just as you say, then, ma’am,” responded Hi.
“But you’re welcome to the meat.”</p>

<p>Billy was already slashing at a string of the jerky;
down it came. Seeing this, the Ohio boy dived into
the wagon and lustily dragged forth a sack of flour.</p>

<p>He shouldered it and staggered with it toward the
Hee-Haw wagon. Billy sprang to take it, but the boy
shook his head stubbornly.</p>

<p>“I’m man enough to tote this,” he panted.</p>

<p>“I reckon you are, sonny,” grinned Hi. “But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
you’ll lemme help you toss it into the wagon, won’t
you? You’re so strong and sassy you’re liable to bust
a hole through the box!”</p>

<p>“How far to Pike’s Peak, strangers?” asked the
woman, anxiously.</p>

<p>“A few hundred miles, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“It seems a powerful long road,” she sighed.
“We’ve come clear from Ohio; drove the whole way.
We started last fall, an’ wintered in Missouri. That’s
where this baby was born.”</p>

<p>“We’ll get there, ma,” encouraged the boy.
“Pap’ll feel better now, an’ we’ll go a-whoopin’.”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” she faltered. “But they do say there
isn’t any gold, anyhow.”</p>

<p>Davy felt sorry for her. Evidently so did the Reverend
Mr. Baxter.</p>

<p>“What is your name, if you please?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Jones. Mrs. Jasper Jones. My man’s a blacksmith.”</p>

<p>“Well, Mrs. Jones, we understand there’s quite a
town going up out at the mountains; and if we get
there before you do we’ll trade this flour in for a corner
lot and your husband can start in blacksmithing.”</p>

<p>“Will you?” she exclaimed, brightening. “Now
that’s mighty kind of you.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take care of you, ma,” comforted the boy,
quickly. “I’ll take care of you an’ pap, too, as soon
as we get where there’s some work.”</p>

<p>“I believe you will, sonny,” spoke Jim admiringly.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
“You’ll make the fur fly. We’ll tell ’em you’re
coming, so they’ll leave space for you.”</p>

<p>And Billy added as good measure:</p>

<p>“When you get to the diggin’s, if you don’t see me
you ask for Billy Cody. I’ll fix you out.”</p>

<p>“Aw, crickity!” gasped the boy, staring. “Say—are
you Billy Cody, the Boy Scout?”</p>

<p>“I’m Billy Cody, all right,” responded Billy, now
somewhat confused, while Hi and Jim and Mr. Baxter
laughed loudly.</p>

<p>“We know you. We read all about you in the
paper,” proclaimed the boy, excited. “That time you
fought the Injuns. Say—will you shake hands with
me?”</p>

<p>“Aw,” stammered Billy, trying to hide behind the
wagon, “forget about that, will you? I’m nobody.”</p>

<p>“Terrible modest all of a sudden, isn’t he!”
chuckled Jim, as he and Hi and the Reverend finished
harnessing the mules again.</p>

<p>“I killed a big buffalo! Biggest one you ever
saw!” squealed Left-over. “Shot him all to pieces
jest as he was running into us. Didn’t I, Billy?”</p>

<p>“Hooray for Left-over!” cheered Hi. “Well,
catch up, boys. We’d better be moving or we’ll never
get thar.” And he addressed the other outfit. “Can
we do anything more for you?”</p>

<p>“No, thank you, strangers,” said both the woman
and the man. “We can make it, now our wagon’s
out. And that meat’ll taste powerful good.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span></p>

<p>“Goodby, then,” called the Hee-Haws.</p>

<p>“Goodby.” And the woman added. “Don’t forget
that corner lot.”</p>

<p>“We won’t.”</p>

<p>The timber lining the course of the various streams
had shrunken, and the streams themselves were dwindling
ever smaller. It was a barren country, this, wide
and sandy and dotted with occasional thumb-like hills
called buttes. Across it wound the trail, marked by
dust and canvas-topped wagons.</p>

<p>“We must be getting near the mountains, boys,”
called Hi. “That last station agent said we were only
two hundred miles from Denver.”</p>

<p>“We ought to see them, then, pretty soon, I should
think,” remarked Mr. Baxter.</p>

<p>“The chances are we’ll be looking for water instead,”
declared Jim. “The country’s going dry on
us.”</p>

<p>The trail had swerved in to the Smoky Hill Fork
again; and the Smoky Hill Fork itself seemed about
to quit. It contained only a mere trickle of water.</p>

<p>“You can follow the stage route on west to the
Big Sandy,” informed a squad of returning Pike’s
Peakers, “or you can cut over to the northward and
find water there. It’s more than twenty-five miles to
where the stage route strikes the Big Sandy, and there
isn’t any water even then. But we hear tell there’s
water on the short cut to the north, where you strike
the Big Sandy higher up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span></p>

<p>Hi nodded thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“All right,” he said. “How’s the country north?”</p>

<p>“There’s nothing to brag on anywhere you go in
this whole region, stranger. We’re bound back to the
States. We’ve had enough. But if you try the short
cut north watch out for the Injuns, ’Rapahoes and
Cheyennes both.”</p>

<p>Hi nodded again.</p>

<p>“We will.”</p>

<p>Davy noted Left-over’s mouth open and his eyes
begin to pop. Presently Left-over could hold in no
longer.</p>

<p>“Lookee here,” he squealed. “Let’s quit. Let’s
turn around with those other fellows and go home.
I’m tired, and I don’t feel very well, and there isn’t
anything at the other end anyhow.”</p>

<p>“If you want to quit you can join the next party
bound east. We can do without you,” spoke Jim.
“But I’m going on if I have to carry the mules.”</p>

<p>“So am I,” declared Billy; and the others, including
Davy, felt the same way.</p>

<p>“I reckon Left-over’s afraid of the Injuns,” commented
Hi.</p>

<p>This seemed to arouse Left-over’s wrath.</p>

<p>“I’m not, either,” he squealed frantically. “The
Injuns had better not bother <em>me</em>. Did you see the
way I downed the big buffalo? That’s what any
Injuns’ll get who tackle <em>me</em>. You fellows don’t know
me when I’m mad. I’m bad. I’m a regular tarrer.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
I’m half horse and half alligator. Those Injuns had
better keep out of my way!”</p>

<p>“We’re mighty glad of your company, Left-over,”
claimed Mr. Baxter soberly. “If I were you I’d ride
the trail and hire out to emigrant parties to see them
through safely.”</p>

<p>Left-over continued to bluster as they marched;
and Billy only remarked to Davy:</p>

<p>“If his ‘do’ is half as big as his ‘tell’ he could
lick Wild Bill, couldn’t he?”</p>

<p>Late that afternoon Hi pointed to the north.</p>

<p>“Here’s a chance for Left-over,” he called.
“We’re going to have visitors!”</p>

<p>“Injuns!” said Billy quickly, shading his eyes and
peering. They all peered—Davy, who was driving,
from the wagon seat.</p>

<p>A band of horsemen were rapidly approaching
across the level sandy plain. By their figures and the
way they rode Indians they certainly were; some
twenty of them. Left-over bellowed wildly.</p>

<p>“I see ’em!” he cried. “I see ’em! Gimme a
gun! Get behind the wagon! Aren’t you going to
stop? Going to let us all be scalped?”</p>

<p>“Quit your yawp!” bade Hi, roughly. “Drive
along, Davy. Handle your guns, boys, so they’ll know
we’re ready. Don’t let them think we’re afraid. I’ll
tend to them at the proper time.”</p>

<p>Minding these instructions of Captain Hi, the Hee-Haw
outfit proceeded as if intent on their own business.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
Left-over whimpered and showed a strong disposition
to climb into the rear of the wagon, but Billy
said sternly:</p>

<p>“None of that! You stay outside. Thought you
were an Injun-fighter.”</p>

<p>“I am,” piped Left-over. “I was going to protect
the wagon.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” grunted Billy.</p>

<p>Up on the seat, in plain sight, driving the mules,
Davy felt rather alone and exposed; but he drove
steadily. The mules were pricking their long ears
and showing uneasiness.</p>

<p>“Watch your animals, Dave,” cautioned Jim. “A
mules hates Injuns wuss ’n a rattlesnake.”</p>

<p>And Davy hung tight.</p>

<p>The Indians bore down at full gallop, as if to cut
the wagon off. But at sight of the guns in the hands
of Hi and Jim and Billy, when within a hundred yards
they reined in sharply and the leader threw up his
hand, palm outward. Hi answered with similar sign.
He rode forward halfway, so did the Indian; they met.</p>

<p>“’Rapahoes,” exclaimed both Billy and Jim.</p>

<p>“Regular beggars,” commented the Reverend,
easily. “Hi’ll fix them.”</p>

<p>Hi and the Arapaho leader came riding toward the
wagon, and the others in the band slowly edged closer.
They were armed mainly with bows and spears, and
did not look very formidable.</p>

<p>“Just a lot of rascals out on a thieving expedition,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
picking up what they can from the emigrants,” announced
Hi. “But of course they claim to be ‘good.’
The chief here’ll show you his recommendations.”</p>

<p>The chief (who was a villainous appearing old fellow,
cross-eyed and marked by small-pox and wearing
a dirty ragged blanket) passed from one to another
of the Hee-Haw company, saying “How, how?”
and shaking hands and extending a bit of dingy paper.</p>

<p>When the paper reached Davy he read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="smfont">“This Indian is Old Smoke. He’ll steal the tail off a mule.
Watch him and pass him along.</p>

<p class="smfont right">“<span class="smcap">Pike’s Peaker.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>The chief grinned and grunted, evidently well
pleased with himself and the impression that he
thought he was making.</p>

<p>“Soog!” he said eagerly. “Soog!”</p>

<p>“No sugar,” answered Hi. “Drive on, Dave.
Needn’t stop.”</p>

<p>But the old Indian kept pace.</p>

<p>“Tobac’. Give tobac’?”</p>

<p>“Nope,” answered Hi, shaking his head. “Puckachee!
Be off! Vamose!”</p>

<p>“Look out for those other Injuns!” suddenly
warned Billy, the alert. “They’re coming right in!”</p>

<p>“Don’t let ’em!” begged Left-over, excited. “Give
him some sugar, so he’ll go away. I’ll give him some.”</p>

<p>“No, you won’t,” retorted Hi, quickly. “Then
he’ll want something else. Here, you—” and he spoke<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
in earnest to the chief. “Puckachee!” And Hi waved
his hand and patted his yager meaningly. “Get! All
of you! No soog, no tobac’, nothing. Keep close to
the wagon, boys,” he warned to his party, “and show
’em we mean business. Drive the mules right along,
Dave.” He shouted to the advanced Indians: “No!
No!” And facing about shifted his gun as for action.</p>

<p>The chief had paused, uncertain; and now his followers
paused. The Hee-Haw wagon, flanked by its
body-guard, with the mules snorting and straining but
controlled by Davy, pressed on. In a moment the chief
rode back to his band, and all went cantering away.</p>

<p>“Lucky for them they didn’t try to make us
trouble,” boasted Left-over, changing his tune but still
suspiciously pale. “We’d have shown ’em!”</p>

<p>“Lucky for us, you mean,” growled Hi. “If once
those fellows had got in amongst us and started to
crowding us thar’s no knowing what mightn’t have
happened. That’s the mistake lots of these emigrants
make. They try to parley and give presents, thinking
they’re buying the Injuns off; and fust thing they
know they’re overrun and helpless and lose their whole
outfit.”</p>

<p>“Were you scared up there, Dave?” called Billy.</p>

<p>“No. Were you down there?” retorted Dave.</p>

<p>“Not so anybody noticed it, I hope,” answered
Billy.</p>

<p>“Well, one thing’s certain,” said Jim. “We’ve<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
got wuss ahead of us than Injuns, I reckon. Water’s
petered out.”</p>

<p>Before their eyes the shallow head-waters of the
Smoky Hill Fork disappeared abruptly, as if soaking
down through the sand of its bed. Davy checked his
mules while Hi and the others surveyed before. Not
a token of water showed beyond or as far as they
could see.</p>

<p>Billy Cody had promptly trudged on in the advance;
and now he shouted and waved.</p>

<p>“Trail forks,” he reported. “One fork keeps on,
other turns off to the right.”</p>

<p>“We’ll follow that right fork as far as we can
before dark,” quoth Hi. “How’s the water bar’l?
Fill her up.”</p>

<p>The Reverend Mr. Baxter sprang to the river bed
and with the camp spade dug vigorously. The others
took pails and pans and kettles and carried water, as
fast as the hole supplied it, to the big cask that, slung
fast at the rear of the wagon, formed part of the trail
kit.</p>

<p>It was slow work filling this cask through the
bung-hole, but Hi kept them at it until the cask was
well-nigh running over. By this time dusk was settling,
and with a shrewd glance about at the landscape
Captain Hi said:</p>

<p>“Unspan, boys. We might as well camp right
hyar. But it’s mighty poor grazing for the mules, I
tell you!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XII">XII<br />
<small>PERILS FOR THE HEE-HAWS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Many emigrants had camped here, evidently. The
grass had been eaten off for several acres around, and
Davy roamed in a circle of a quarter of a mile before
he had gleaned enough buffalo chips for the supper fire.</p>

<p>“Better get enough for breakfast, too, Dave,”
warned Mr. Baxter, the cook, with a weather-wise
eye cocked at the horizon. “Hear the thunder?
We’re liable to be soaked and so will the chips.”</p>

<p>Buffalo chips when dry were fine, quick, hot fuel;
but when wet they were hopeless, like soggy paste-board.
Mr. Baxter’s warning had been well founded,
for the air was heavy and warmish, and from some
distant point echoed the rumble of a storm.</p>

<p>Up to this time the journey from Leavenworth had
been very comfortable as to weather, with sunny days
and occasional little rains. But, according to Billy and
all, some of these plains storms were regular “tail
twisters” and “stem winders,” drowning even the
prairie-dogs out of their holes!</p>

<p>“Left-over’s first on guard to-night,” directed
Captain Hi. “We must keep eye and ear open for
those Injuns. They may sneak up and run off our
mules.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span></p>

<p>“They’d better not try it when I’m on guard,”
blustered Left-over, in his funny squeak. “You’ll
lemme have your gun, won’t you, Jim?”</p>

<p>“Not much!” rapped Jim. “I may want that gun
myself. Take one of Billy’s. Let him have your
yager, Billy. What have you got in it?”</p>

<p>“A bullet and three buckshot. I loaded her for
Injuns.”</p>

<p>“That’s right. Left-over can do a toler’ble lot of
shooting with that load.”</p>

<p>Pleased, Left-over took the gun and posted himself
just outside the firelight, where he could oversee
camp and mules (now tethered near) and any prowling
figures approaching. The night settled black and thick,
with the stars faintly twinkling through a haze; but
wrapped in his blanket beside Billy, Dave soon fell
asleep.</p>

<p>He was awakened by a loud bang, and a louder
howl from Left-over, who seemed to be stepping on
everybody at once.</p>

<p>“Injuns! I’m killed! Help! Murder! Wake
up! Why don’t you wake? Help! Murder! Injuns!
Injuns!”</p>

<p>Before Davy had collected his own wits and was
out from the blanket Billy had sprung up like a deer;
with the one motion he was on his feet, free of the
blanket, revolver in hand, ready to obey Captain Hi’s
sharp voice.</p>

<p>“Shut up! (to Left-over, who was cavorting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
around like whale in a flurry). Lie low, boys! Over
here, together, away from the fire. Where are they,
Left-over? What’s the matter? What’d you see?”</p>

<p>“I’m killed,” wailed Left-over. “The whole
country’s full of Injuns—’Rapahoes. I shot into
’em when they were sneaking up, and then they shot
me through the head. It all happened at once. But
I saved the mules. I gave my life for ’em, and you-all.”
And Left-over groaned vigorously.</p>

<p>Half deafened by the wails of Left-over, Davy had
been listening hard for Indian whoop or rustle, and
peering for shadowy forms. But he heard only the
breathing of his companions and the grunty sighs of
the aroused mules. Not a figure, except those of the
shadowy mules, just visible against the sky-line, could
be descried.</p>

<p>“Aw, shucks!” grumbled Billy, suddenly, breaking
the suspense. And standing boldly, he strode to the
smouldering camp-fire and thrust a bit of paper into
the live ashes. He made a plain target, but he did
not seem to care, and waited for the paper to flare.</p>

<p>In the flare they all stared around; the mules were
the first things noted—but Mr. Baxter exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Look at Left-over! By jiminy, he is wounded!
Start that fire more or make a torch so we can see.
Wait a minute, Left-over.”</p>

<p>Left-over certainly presented an alarming sight.
His face was welling blood, which streamed down upon
his chest. His eyes rolled and he groaned dismally.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span></p>

<p>As Billy made another flare, Jim, nearest to Left-over,
hastily examined, with eyes and deft fingers,
Left-over groaning now terribly.</p>

<p>“Don’t find anything—there ain’t any new hole;
mostly mouth,” Jim reported. “Can’t you hold your
yawp, Left-over, long enough to tell us what happened
to you?”</p>

<p>“I saw the Injuns sneaking up and we all shot at
the same time, and I killed them and they killed me,”
sobbed Left-over. “If you don’t believe me go out
and look.”</p>

<p>“I know,” quoth Billy Cody. “That gun kicked
him in the face and plumb broke his nose! She was
loaded to do business.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” grunted Left-over, venturing to sit up
and feel of his face.</p>

<p>“If you fellows’ll watch I’ll scout around a bit
and see what’s what outside,” proffered Billy. “I
keep seeing something lying out yonder. Shouldn’t
wonder if Left-over did kill an Injun.”</p>

<p>The lightning was fitful but incessant; its pallid
flashes played over the landscape—momentarily revealing
the drooping mules, the spots of sage, the
wagon, the faces on Davy’s right and left, and (as
seemed to Davy) exposing, for a brief instance, a dark
mass lying farther out on the prairie.</p>

<p>“Well——” began Captain Hi; but he was interrupted.
As if borne on the wings of a sudden cool gust
from the west there came fresh blare of thunder and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
glare of lightning. Peal succeeded peal, flash succeeded
flash, with scarce an interval. Hi’s voice rang sternly.</p>

<p>“Billy, you and Dave see to those mules, quick,
or they’ll stampede. The rest of you pitch what stuff
you can into the wagon and stretch guy-ropes to hold
her down. This is an old rip-snorter of a storm, and
it’s coming with its head down and tail up!”</p>

<p>Nobody paused to question or debate. The storm
seemed right upon them. Following Billy, Dave
leaped for the mules.</p>

<p>“Tie ’em to the wagon wheels,” yelled Billy, in
the pale glare tugging at a picket pin.</p>

<p>He and Davy hauled the mules along to the wagon,
where Hi and Jim, Mr. Baxter and even the gory Left-over
were hustling frantically to put things under cover
and make the wagon fast with guy-ropes stretched taut
over the top.</p>

<p>But the storm scarcely waited. The bellow of the
thunder and the fierce play of the lightning increased.
There was a pause, a patter, a swift gust; and rushing
out of the inky night charged the rain.</p>

<p>Rain? Sheets of it! Blinding, drenching sheets of
it, driven by gust after gust, and riven by peal after
peal, glare after glare.</p>

<p>“Hang to the wagon, everybody!” shouted Captain
Hi; and Davy, hanging hard, could see, amidst the
cataract of water, his partners also hanging hard to
guy-ropes and wagon-sheet corners. The mules stood<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
drooped and huddled, their ears flat and their tails
turned to the storm.</p>

<p>Never had there been such lightning, never such
thunder, never such rain! All in a moment, as it
seemed to Davy, he was soaked through and through,
and the ground under him was running with water an
inch deep. The wagon top bellied and slapped and
jerked, and every instant was threatening to tear loose
and sail away, or else lift the wagon and all with it.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” yelled Billy gaily, braced and panting,
as he tried to anchor his corner. Nothing daunted
Billy Cody. “Now we’ve got water a-plenty!”</p>

<p>As suddenly as it had arrived the bulk of the storm
departed, leaving only a drizzle, and a very wet world.
The Hee-Haw party might release their grip on the
wagon, and take stock. The rain had driven through
the canvas top into the bedding and other stuff, and
the rest of the night bid fair to be rather uncomfortable.</p>

<p>“What are we going to do now?” whined Left-over.</p>

<p>“Do the best we can,” answered Captain Hi.
“Stand up or lie down, whichever you please, till
morning.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you going out to look at my Injun?”</p>

<p>“He’ll keep. We’ve got enough to tend to right
hyar.”</p>

<p>Mr. Baxter lighted the lantern, and they overhauled
the bedding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span></p>

<p>“Come on, Davy,” quoth Billy. “I’m going to
sleep. Crawl in and we’ll shiver ourselves warm.”</p>

<p>Billy’s buffalo robe was spread down on a spot
where the rain already had soaked into the sandy soil,
and snuggled beside him, under a blanket, dressed just
as he was, Dave soon found himself growing warm.</p>

<p>“’Twon’t hurt us any,” murmured Billy. “I’ve
been wet this way many a time before. If we don’t
change our clothes we won’t catch cold.”</p>

<p>That was fortunate, for they had no clothes to
change to!</p>

<p>When Dave awakened, the sun was almost up; he
was nearly dry, and had not been uncomfortable, after
all. The Reverend Mr. Baxter was trying to start a
fire with bits of wood from some of the boxes in the
wagon, and to dry out a few buffalo chips. Left-over
was snoring lustily, but the rest of the camp was turning
out. Billy, who was sitting up, gazing about,
whooped joyously.</p>

<p>“Look at Left-over’s Injun!” he cried, pointing.
Out he sprang and hustled across the plain. The camp
began to laugh—all but Davy, who stared, blinking,
and Left-over, who stirred, half aroused.</p>

<p>At the dark spot, which was Left-over’s Indian,
Billy stopped; he waved his hand and cheered, and
came back, dragging the thing. As he drew near,
Davy saw what the others had seen. The Indian was
a big calf!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span></p>

<p>“Shot it plumb through the head!” yelped Billy.
“’Rah for Left-over!”</p>

<p>“What is it? What’s the matter?” stammered
Left-over, struggling to sit up, while he blinked, red-eyed.</p>

<p>“Better take his tail for your scalp, Left-over,”
bade Jim. “It’s a pity we don’t need meat, but you
can butcher him if you want to.”</p>

<p>Not for some weeks did the Hee-Haw outfit get
done teasing Left-over about his “Injuns.”</p>

<p>“Anyway,” soothed Mr. Baxter, “you made a
good shot. Nobody can deny you that.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” agreed Left-over, swelling importantly.
“I knew it was something, and I drew bead and whaled
away.”</p>

<p>“Purty good to draw bead in the dark,” remarked
Captain Hi. “Left-over must have eyes like a cat!”</p>

<p>They ate a rather scant breakfast, mostly cold; and
leaving the luckless calf (which must have wandered
from some emigrant party) minus a few steaks, they
turned northwest on the cut-off to the next water.
The stage route went straight on, over a bare plateau;
but a number of emigrants evidently had been turning
off here on a trail of their own.</p>

<p>So sandy was the soil and so hot the sun that very
soon the ground was as dry as before, and Billy’s
boast of “plenty water” failed to make good.</p>

<p>About the middle of the morning they passed an
emigrant train of a large party still recovering from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
the storm. Wagons had been capsized, tents torn up
bodily, and equipage scattered far and wide. One
wagon had been carried away completely.</p>

<p>“How far to the mountains, strangers?” queried
one of the emigrants. It was the same old question.
All the Pike’s Peak travellers appeared to have the one
thing in mind—the mountains.</p>

<p>“Follow us and you’ll get thar,” replied Captain
Hi. “What do you know about this cut-off?”</p>

<p>“Nothing at all, stranger. There looked as if
somebody had gone up this way, so we came too.”</p>

<p>“It’s a terrible dry road, though,” sighed a woman.
“Maybe if we’d have kept on west we’d have done
better.”</p>

<p>“Well, by jiminy!” said Hi, as the Hee-Haws
toiled on. “I sort of think so, myself. This trail
doesn’t look good to me; not a little bit.”</p>

<p>“Shall we turn back?” proposed Mr. Baxter.</p>

<p>“I hate to turn back,” spoke Billy promptly. “I
like to keep a-going.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we might as well go on,” added Jim. “I
hate to back track, too. But there aren’t many emigrants
on this trail, that’s certain.”</p>

<p>“The trouble is they’ll follow like sheep,” asserted
the Reverend. “If this cut-off is no good somebody
ought to put a sign on it.”</p>

<p>Hotter and hotter grew the day. The trail, which
was not so large after the emigrant party had been
passed, wound among blistering sand-hills, and soon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
the mules were plodding doggedly, with tongues out,
hides lathering. They guided themselves, for the Reverend,
whose turn it was to drive, had mercy on them
and walked. That night at camp he uttered a sudden
exclamation.</p>

<p>“Water’s more than half gone, boys,” he announced.
“Either this keg leaks or the air drinks
faster than we do.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to be easy on water, then,” ordered
Captain Hi. And they all went to bed thirsty.</p>

<p>Davy had a miserable night, and probably the rest
did, too, although nobody except Left-over said anything.
The mules started out stiffly. But Mr. Baxter
suddenly shouted, in a queer wheeze, pointing:</p>

<p>“Cheer up, fellows! There’s either a cloud or a
mountain—see?”</p>

<p>They peered. Away in the west, just touched by
the first rays of the sun, peeped over the rolling desert,
at the horizon edge, a vague outline that did look like
the tip of a cloud.</p>

<p>“There’s another!” cried Billy, pointing further
to the north. “If those are mountains I reckon this
one is Long’s Peak; maybe that other is Pike’s Peak.”</p>

<p>Davy gazed constantly at the two vague, cloudlike
breaks in the line of horizon and sky. As the sun rose
higher they seemed to grow whiter; but they did not
move. They must be mountains, then; and oh, so
far away! Occasionally, as the wagon labored over a
swell in the desert, Davy thought that he could descry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
other mountains in an irregular ridge connecting the
tip in the north with the tip at the south. However,
as the sun shone fiercer the whole sandy plain quivered
with the heat rays and the horizon blurred. Nobody
seemed to care about the mountains now; the main
thought was getting through to water.</p>

<p>The trail was almost drifted over by sand; the
Hee-Haw party appeared to be the only party travelling
it. That was discouraging. The mules scarcely
moved. At noon they were given a little drink out of
Hi’s hat, for the wooden bucket had warped and leaked
like a sieve. Davy never had been so thirsty in all his
life, and Left-over had to be forced back by main
strength from the nearly empty cask. That night,
camped in a dry watercourse, where they dug and dug
without finding any moisture, they used the last of
their water for coffee.</p>

<p>“It’s make or break, to-morrow, boys,” said Captain
Hi. “We’ll start as early as we can see, and
push right through. Ought to strike water soon. The
nearer we get to the mountains the better the chance
for water from them.”</p>

<p>Sunrise of the third day caught them plodding
ahead, the poor mules groaning and wheezing, the
wagon rolling sluggishly, and Davy, like the rest, with
mouth open and tongue bone dry, in the wake. The
cloud things in the horizon had remained stationary;
some of them were whitish, some purplish; and mountains
they certainly were!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span></p>

<p>About ten o’clock Billy cried out thickly.</p>

<p>“Water, fellows! Look at those mules’ ears!
They smell it!”</p>

<p>“’Pears like a creek yonder, sure,” mumbled Captain
Hi. “Don’t be disappointed, though, if it’s another
mirage.” For they had been fooled several times
by the heat waves picturing water.</p>

<p>“Those mules smell water, just the same, I bet
you,” insisted Billy.</p>

<p>Far in the distance shimmered now a thin fringe of
green. The mules actually increased their pace; they
broke into a labored trot; and shambling heavily behind
the outfit pressed on. Left-over groaned and dropped,
to lie and moan dismally.</p>

<p>“I’m dying,” he wheezed. “I can’t move a step.
Are you fellows going on and leave me?”</p>

<p>There was no holding the mules. As they forged
along Billy exclaimed quickly:</p>

<p>“Wait here, Left-over. Go ahead, fellows. I’ll
fetch him back a drink.”</p>

<p>And seizing the coffee-pot he sturdily ran and
stumbled to the fore. All hastened after him, rivalling
the frantic mules, but he beat.</p>

<p>Water it was! When they approached it did not
vanish as a mirage would; and they met Billy returning
with coffee-pot actually dripping as its precious
contents slopped over.</p>

<p>Davy felt a strong impulse to halt Billy, wrest the
pot from him, and drink long and deep. But of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
course this was only a thought. Puffing, Billy passed.</p>

<p>“There’s plenty water waiting you,” he announced.
“I’ll bring Left-over on after he’s had his
drink.”</p>

<p>Yes, water it was—a real stream flowing crooked
and shallow in a deep bed bordered by brush and willows.
The trail led to a ford. Wagon and all, the
mules fairly plunged in, and burying their noses to
their eyes gulped and gulped. First Jim, then in quick
succession Davy and Captain Hi and Mr. Baxter (who
was the last of all) imitated the mules. Whew, but
that drink was a good long one! It seemed to Davy,
as he sucked again and again, that he simply could not
swallow fast enough.</p>

<p>“Some head stream or other, I reckon,” finally
spoke Captain Hi. “Shouldn’t wonder if we had
water now all the way in. We’re getting where the
drainage from the mountains begins to cut some
figger.”</p>

<p>Billy arrived with Left-over. They spent the rest
of the day beside the welcome stream; and by morning
they left about as strong as ever.</p>

<p>The trail that they were following now crossed at
least one stream a day, so that the water cask was kept
filled. The buffalo jerky had been eaten or was not
eatable; but antelope and black-tail deer were abundant.
So the trail proved pleasant. Captain Hi called
attention to the fact that the water was growing colder
to the taste; and he said that the snow mountains must<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
therefore be nearer. Indeed, the mountains were
nearer; they lined the whole western horizon, and
made a humpy, dark ridge extending from straight
ahead far up into the north. A haze like to a fog veiled
them much of the time, and the Hee-Haw party were
always expecting a better view.</p>

<p>Anyway, there were the Rocky Mountains in sight;
and little by little the trail was approaching them.
Yet it was a long, long trail, and who would have imagined
that the plains were so broad from Leavenworth
to the digging!</p>

<p>However, one morning a surprise occurred. The
trail had been threading a little divide which evidently
separated one stream from another. A few pines were
growing on it. They smelled good. When the mules
had tugged the wagon over the last rise and were descending
a splendid spectacle unfolded to the eyes of
the Hee-Haws. Involuntarily they cheered—hooray!
and again hooray! For right before them was the
main trail once more, with the wagons of emigrants
whitening it and with a stage dashing along.</p>

<p>Down hastened the Hee-Haws, even the mules
being glad of company.</p>

<p>“Hooray for Cherry Creek and the diggin’s,
strangers!” was the greeting, as the Hee-Haw party
entered at a break in the toiling procession.</p>

<p>“How much further, lads?” asked Captain Hi.</p>

<p>“Whar?”</p>

<p>“To the mountains?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span></p>

<p>“Seventy miles to the diggin’s, we hear tell. This
is the head o’ Cherry Creek, hyar; and as soon as the
fog lifts you’ll see what you’re looking for, I reckon.”</p>

<p>The fog, which had cloaked the horizon since sunrise,
already was thinning; and staring, the Hee-Haws
waited the result.</p>

<p>“I see them!” cried Jim, waving his battered hat.</p>

<p>“Where, Jim?”</p>

<p>“Yonder, straight in front.”</p>

<p>“So do I!” yelped Billy. “There’s Long’s Peak—that
big peak up at the north end. I’ve seen him from
the Overland Trail. Look at the snow, will you!”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it wonderful!” breathed the Reverend Mr.
Baxter, in awed tone.</p>

<p>And it was. Almost halting, spell-bound, they
gazed. As the fog broke and melted away it exposed
a mighty barrier, extending in a vast sweep from the
right to the left—two hundred miles of mountains,
the front range soft and purplish, the back range dazzling
white with snow. The rugged plains, brushy and
somewhat timbered, and lighter green where meandered
Cherry Creek, reached to their very base.</p>

<p>“Where’s Pike’s Peak?” demanded Left-over.</p>

<p>“That lone peak at our end, stranger,” informed
an emigrant.</p>

<p>Round and bulky and snow covered, standing out
by himself, like an exclamation-point completing the
range, Pike’s Peak seemed the biggest peak of all.</p>

<p>“That’s not far. ’Tisn’t more than ten miles!”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
declared Left-over. “Come on! Let’s go and climb
it. Get out your picks, fellows! Don’t you see a kind
of yellow patch? That’s gold, I bet you.”</p>

<p>“Keep cool, young man,” warned the emigrant.
“You try to walk it before night and you’ll find out
how far that peak is. More than fifty miles, I reckon.”</p>

<p>“It looks powerful cold up yon,” quavered a
woman. “They do say the snow never melts off.”</p>

<p>The trail was now much more interesting. Some
of the emigrants had come out, like the Hee-Haws,
over the Smoky Hill Fork Trail, and the others were
from the Santa Fe Trail up the Arkansas River, to
the south. A trail along the base of the mountains connected
this with Smoky Hill Trail. Soon the trail by
way of Republican River joined in. The triple travel
on Cherry Creek Trail was now so thick that Davy
again wondered where all the people were coming from.</p>

<p>The marvellous panorama of the Rockies remained
ever in sight before. Nobody tired of gazing at it,
wondering which of the peaks, besides Pike’s Peak,
were inlaid with gold and if a fellow could live on top
of Pike’s Peak or back yonder among those other peaks
while getting out his fortune. Some of the emigrants
(Left-over included) asserted loudly that they could
see the gold shining!</p>

<p>However, the first sight of the Pike’s Peak settlements—Denver
and Auraria—began to be watched for
the most eagerly. The mountains gradually drew
nearer, Pike’s Peak gradually fell behind until on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
afternoon of the third day, down the winding, white-topped
procession swept a glad cry. Whips were flourished,
sun-bonnets were waved, hats were swung; men
and women cheered, children shouted, dogs barked.</p>

<p>“The Cherry Creek diggin’s! There they are!
There are the gold fields and the pound a day!”</p>

<p>People seemed to forget the bad reports spread by
the disgruntled emigrants bound back to the States.
Hopes were again high for success and fortune at the
end of the long, long trail.</p>

<p>Sure enough, several miles before, in a basin set
out from the mountains a short distance, were a collection
of wagons and tents and other canvases, and
a number of cabins, also, jumbled together on both
sides of the creek, apparently, and bounded before by
a wooded river. At the edges was a fringe of little
camps like those of emigrants stopping by the way.</p>

<p>Evening was nigh; the sun was low over the snowy
range; smoke was curling from camp-fire and chimney.</p>

<p>“We won’t make it to-day, fellows,” spoke Captain
Hi. “But we’ll pull in the first thing in the morning.”</p>

<p>“Goodness! Look at the people pouring in by the
northern trail, too!” exclaimed Mr. Baxter.</p>

<p>For glinting in the last rays of the sun a long wagon
train of emigrants, resembling crawling white beads,
was heading in from the opposite direction.</p>

<p>“That’s the cut-off down from the Salt Lake
Overland Trail up the Platte,” quoth Billy, promptly.
“The bull trains travel that trail.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XIII">XIII<br />
<small>THE CHERRY CREEK DIGGIN’S</small></h2>
</div>


<p>With so many people making for Cherry Creek
over several trails it seemed a pity to waste a night by
camping. But when darkness settled the trail was
ablaze with the camp-fires of the emigrants who, like
the Hee-Haw outfit, had halted until dawn. Afar
blinked the lights of the “Pike’s Peak settlements”;
and miles distant, north across the plain, were the
bright dots betokening the camps of those emigrants
entering by the Salt Lake Overland Trail.</p>

<p>The whole procession was early astir with the
dawn; even Left-over was up as soon as anybody,
eager to be digging out his pound of gold a day.</p>

<p>The trail down Cherry Creek was six inches deep
with dust, ground to powder by the constant wheels
and hoofs. In a great cloud it rose as the wagons and
animals and persons ploughed through it; to the north
lifted other dust lines, where the rival travel likewise
pressed forward to the goal. It was an inspiring scene,
almost as good as a race; but Left-over grumbled:</p>

<p>“I don’t call this Pike’s Peak,” he said. “And
where’s Denver City? I don’t see any city.”</p>

<p>“City or not,” remarked the Reverend Mr. Baxter,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
“it’s a wonderful thing, Davy—all these people, from
all over the United States, setting out overland, breaking
new trails, and founding a town away out here, six
hundred miles across the desert, at the foot of those
snowy mountains! It’s taken a lot of pluck and a lot
of trust in Providence.”</p>

<p>“Where do you calculate on stopping, boys?”
queried a black-eyed, sharp-nosed man who was riding
down along the column.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” drawled Captain Hi. “What’s
the difference?”</p>

<p>“All the difference in the world. Throw in with
Auraria. She’s on the mountain side of the Creek,
and she’s bound to be the biggest city west of Omaha.
We’ve got the buildings, the people, and the ferry
across the Platte River. Remember that. Don’t let
these Denver boomers fool you. Stop at Auraria and
we’ll treat you right.”</p>

<p>And he rode on down the line talking about
“Auraria.”</p>

<p>But he was close followed by another man—a
fatty, red-faced man.</p>

<p>“Keep right on down the east side of the creek to
Denver City,” he proclaimed. “The travelled side,
the side next to the States. Buy a town lot in Denver;
it’ll be a nest-egg for you while you’re at the diggin’s.
Denver, Denver, Denver! Remember the east side of
the creek.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span></p>

<p>And he, also, proceeded on, chanting the praises of
“Denver City.” The Reverend Mr. Baxter laughed.</p>

<p>Before they reached the settlement district the trail
forked. A large sign, pointing to the left-hand fork,
said: “AURARIA. Direct Route to the Gold Fields.”
Another sign, pointing before, said: “Straight Ahead
for DENVER CITY. Nearest and Best.”</p>

<p>“Which will it be, boys?” queried Captain Hi.</p>

<p>“Let’s try Denver. It’s on this side of the creek
and it’s named for the governor of Kansas,” spoke
Mr. Baxter.</p>

<p>So they continued on down to Denver City.
Denver and Auraria were separated by only the almost
dry channels of Cherry Creek, and both extended along
it nearly to the Platte River below, into which Cherry
Creek emptied. As soon as the Hee-Haw party had
pitched their camp on the outskirts of Denver, they
hastened about their business. Davy and Mr. Baxter
paired off to wander about. Billy and Hi and Jim
undertook some errands. Left-over was wild to grab
shovel and pick and pan and start right in digging and
washing.</p>

<p>Many persons, in plain sight all up and down the
creek bed, were working hard panning for gold. Some
of the emigrants had begun almost before they had
unharnessed their teams. And yonder, northwest,
glimpses of the Platte River, flowing past both Denver
and Auraria, gave glimpses also of other miners
delving away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span></p>

<p>Billy walked straight to the nearest group in the
creek bed.</p>

<p>“How are you making it, pardner?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Have you fellows come for your pound a day,
too?” asked the man. Even his wife was wielding a
dish-pan while he shovelled.</p>

<p>“You bet,” assured Billy.</p>

<p>The woman paused, and the man laughed wearily
and wiped his forehead.</p>

<p>“You’ll be lucky if you make fifty cents,” he said.</p>

<p>“Yes,” quavered the woman. “It’s awful poor
picking along this creek. I expect we’re all going to
starve, provisions are getting so high.”</p>

<p>“Where are the diggin’s, then?”</p>

<p>“Yonder, up in the mountains, stranger. We hear
tell they’ve made a big strike there. We’re going on
as soon as we can travel. But our oxen are about
petered out.”</p>

<p>“How far’s Pike’s Peak?” demanded Left-over.
“Where’s the Pike’s Peak country? Why don’t you
go to Pike’s Peak?”</p>

<p>“That’s Pike’s Peak down south, seventy-five
miles,” answered the man. “They call this the Pike’s
Peak country, but it’s only a name. I reckon you’ve
heard of them sliding down Pike’s Peak and scraping
up the gold as they slide. Don’t you believe it, mister.
The peak’s above snow line and the ground is frozen
solid. See that line of wagons? They’re all heading<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
to the new Gregory diggin’s, west in the mountains
about forty miles. That’s the big strike.”</p>

<p>“Oh, shucks!” exclaimed Billy.</p>

<p>Davy felt his heart sink; this, then, was not the
end of the gold-seekers’ trail, and the snowy mountains,
topping the barrier of the tumbled foot-hills,
looked like a hard country.</p>

<p>“Come, Davy,” said the Reverend Mr. Baxter.
“We’ll see the sights first, anyway.”</p>

<p>So they left Left-over, hauling out his pick and
spade and gold-pan to join the squads working along
the creek; and Hi and Jim and Billy, who set forth on
errands; and trudged away “to see the sights.”</p>

<p>“This gold craze is all right as a means of attracting
the people here,” remarked the Reverend Mr.
Baxter, thoughtfully. “But the most wonderful part
to me is the settlement itself. There must be fifteen
hundred population already in scarce a year, and emigrants
are pouring in at the rate of a thousand a day,
I hear. There are fifty thousand on the way, Dave.
I don’t give a snap for the mines; but look, what has
happened! This gold excitement is going to settle
the plains. The United States has jumped at a leap
from the Missouri River six or seven hundred miles
to the mountains. With a city here, and cities at the
other end, there’ll soon be cities in between. A whole
lot of waste country is due to be made useful.”</p>

<p>“I don’t call this much of a city yet,” commented<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
Davy, considerably disappointed over the end of his
trip.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mr. Baxter, “it’s the starter for one
if the people don’t starve to death. The weak hearts
will go back; the strong ones will stick; it’s only a
question of holding out for a while until the land is
cultivated.”</p>

<p>Truly, Denver was a strange collection of tents
and shacks, with a few good buildings. The houses
were of hewn logs, sod roofs and dirt floors, and the
furniture was made mostly from slabs and planks.
There were few windows; and these were filled with
sacking stretched across or else had wooden shutters.
As far as Davy could see, the whole town did not
have a pane of glass.</p>

<p>However, the streets (and particularly the two
main streets named Blake and Larimer) were thronged
with people as thick as the crowds at the other end of
the route, Leavenworth. Indians, Mexicans and whites
fairly jostled elbows, and conversation in every variety
of speech was heard. The whites wore costumes
ranging from the broadcloth frock coat and flowing
trousers of the St. Louis and New York merchant to
the flannel shirt, jeans trousers and heavy boots of the
regular plainsman and miner. The Mexicans wore
their broad, high-peaked hats and their serapes or gay
Mexican blankets, draped from their shoulders. The
Indians stalked about bare-headed, and enveloped in
their blankets also. There were few women.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span></p>

<p>Several stores handling general merchandise had
been opened, but according to the signs goods were expensive.
One sign said: “Antelope Meat, 4 cents a
lb.” Picks and spades were the cheapest; they could
be bought for fifteen cents apiece, and nobody seemed
to be buying at that! This was a bad sign; it showed
how disgusted many of the overlanders had become
when they found that they could not dig gold out by
the pound where they stopped!</p>

<p>Right in the centre of Denver was a large village
of Indians, camped in their tipis. By the hundreds
they were lounging about, men, women and children,
the men unclothed except for a girdle about the waist,
and the children wearing nothing at all.</p>

<p>“Arapahoes,” pronounced Mr. Baxter. “Come
on, Davy. There’s the stage. Let’s go over to the
hotel.”</p>

<p>A large cloth sign before a long one-story log
building said: “Denver House.” It was next to the
Arapahoe village. People were hurrying across to this
hotel, for a stage-coach, with crack of whip and cheer
from passengers and driver, had halted short in front
of it.</p>

<p>The coach, drawn by its four mules, dusty and
lathered, bore the lettering: “Leavenworth &amp; Pike’s
Peak Express Co.” So this, then, was the daily
Leavenworth stage. Already the street before the
hotel was crowded with onlookers who had gathered
to receive the coach. When Davy and Mr. Baxter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
arrived the travel-worn passengers were clambering
out. The first was Mr. Majors himself! Davy recognized
the long beard and he and Mr. Baxter pressed
forward to welcome their friend.</p>

<p>“Why, hello, boys,” quoth Mr. Majors. “Where’d
you drop from?”</p>

<p>“Just got in,” answered Mr. Baxter, shaking
hands, as did Davy. “We came by mule and wagon
with Billy Cody and two or three others.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“Up the Smoky.”</p>

<p>“Joined the gold rush, did you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. But I’ve about decided I’d rather plant
potatoes.”</p>

<p>“How about you, Dave?” queried Mr. Majors.</p>

<p>“I’d like to eat one,” asserted Davy ruefully.</p>

<p>“You’ve got the right idea, I guess,” approved
Mr. Majors. “But I understand Horace Greeley has
told the people here they ought to plant potatoes, and
they laughed at him. Potatoes are a better crop than
gold, in my opinion; but this country certainly doesn’t
look very promising for them. How people are going
to live I don’t know. It will be good for the freighting
business, though. We’ll be hauling stuff in here with
every team we can muster. Did you know we’ve taken
over the stage line, too?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, we have. It’s run by Russell, Majors &amp;
Waddell now. Call in on me before I leave, and I’ll<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
give you a pass to Leavenworth in case you want to
go back.”</p>

<p>“All right. Thank you, Mr. Majors.”</p>

<p>“If I were you, my lad, I wouldn’t stay around
here long,” continued Mr. Majors to Davy. “This
place is going to be a good place, and I haven’t any
doubt that lots of gold will come out of these mountains
as soon as the people are experienced in finding
it. But looking for gold haphazard is a poor job for
a boy. I think you’ll do much better on the plains.
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, you know;
and there’s a big work to be done in helping these
people live. If the freight outfits aren’t kept moving
the diggings will starve. If you’ll come in to Leavenworth
we’ll put you to work with the bull trains.”</p>

<p>“You’d better do it, Davy,” advised Mr. Baxter.
And Davy soberly nodded.</p>

<p>“I guess I will, then.”</p>

<p>“I’m up at our Nebraska City office most of the
time now,” said Mr. Majors. “But you’ll find Mr.
Russell at Leavenworth and I’ll tell him to fix you out.”
And Mr. Majors shouldered his way into the hotel.</p>

<p>“Whar’s the post-office, stranger?” asked a voice;
and turning they faced an emigrant evidently newly
arrived.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. We’re lost around here, ourselves,”
explained Mr. Baxter.</p>

<p>“Pardon. I tella the way,” spoke somebody else.
He was a tall, swarthy-visaged man, with heavy black<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
moustache and black bushy eyebrows, a large meerschaum
pipe in his mouth. However, he was neatly
dressed, even to natty shoes. He looked like a foreigner,
and his accent sounded foreign. He continued
rapidly: “That beeg house w’ere you see-a the
line of men.”</p>

<p>“Thank ’ee,” acknowledged the emigrant, after a
hearty stare. And he strode off.</p>

<p>“And you, signors? Canna I direct you zomeplace?”
inquired the foreign man, with a bow.</p>

<p>“We’re just looking around, is all,” informed Mr.
Baxter.</p>

<p>“Then later. Perhappa for the hair or the whiskers;
perhappa for the wash. Permitta me.” And
with another bow he handed to Mr. Baxter and to
Davy his card.</p>

<p>It read: “H. Murat. Tonsorial Artist. Shaves,
Trims and Cuts. Laundry Done.”</p>

<p>“Do you know who he is?” piped another voice
at Davy’s side, as the dark foreigner disappeared in
the crowd. “He’s a count, a real Italian count.”</p>

<p>The speaker was a slender, fair-haired little fellow,
not much older than Dave himself.</p>

<p>“He’s Count Murat. His father was a big man
in Italy. But out here the count’s a barber and his
wife takes in washing.”</p>

<p>“I declare!” ejaculated Mr. Baxter. “And where
did you come from, son?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span></p>

<p>“From the States. I’ve been up in the diggin’s,
but I froze my feet and I’m going home.”</p>

<p>“Are your folks here?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. I ran away. But I’ve got enough and
when I reach home I’m going to stay there.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’d better,” approved Mr. Baxter.
“You’re too young to be out here alone.”</p>

<p>“I guess I am,” admitted the little fellow. “Life
out here is fierce unless you’re used to it.”</p>

<p>“How are the diggin’s?” queried Davy, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Forty miles into the mountains—and then always
a little farther,” asserted the young fellow. “If you
can stick it out and don’t freeze to death or starve to
death you may make a few hundred dollars—and you
may not. Did you ever mine?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Davy, and Mr. Baxter shook his head,
smiling.</p>

<p>“Then you’re tenderfeet like I am. That’s the
trouble in there. Half the people don’t know how to
find gold and the other half don’t know it when they
do find it. It’s fierce, I tell you. <em>I’m</em> bound home,
busted. I had to walk in, fifty miles; but I’ve earned
just enough to take me through to the Missouri.”</p>

<p>“How?” asked Davy.</p>

<p>“Sweeping out for one of the gambling houses,”
and with a gesture of disgust the slender youngster
turned away.</p>

<p>Mr. Baxter watched him a moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span></p>

<p>“Davy,” he uttered, “that’s no boy. That’s a girl.
Great Scott! What a place for a girl!”</p>

<p>And later they found out that Mr. Baxter had
spoken the truth. They were glad to learn that the
pretended boy took the next stage back to Leavenworth
and reached there safely.</p>

<p>“Let’s try our luck at the post-office,” proposed
Mr. Baxter. “I’d like to get a letter, myself.”</p>

<p>They threaded their way in the direction of the
office. The mail had recently come in, for from the
post-office window a line of men, single file, extended
over a block. However, before they two took their
places Billy Cody stopped them.</p>

<p>“I asked for your mail,” he announced. “There
wasn’t any. I got a letter from ma. All she said was:
‘Dear Will. Let us know how you are. We are well.
Mother.’ And I had to pay fifty cents for it down
from Laramie. The new stage line carries letters for
twenty-five cents. Wish ma had written more for the
money. She might just as well.”</p>

<p>“What’s the news, Billy? What are you and the
rest of the outfit going to do?”</p>

<p>“Hi and Jim and I are going on up to the diggin’s
right away. See that line of travel?” And Billy
pointed to the constant procession of wagons and of
people afoot, extending from the settlement as far as
the eye could reach, westward into the hills fifteen miles
distant. They’re all going. Left-over’s quit and
joined another outfit. He couldn’t wait. Jim and Hi<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
are buying supplies. Did you notice the prices?
Eggs are two dollars and a half a dozen. Milk fifty
cents a quart. Flour ten dollars for a fifty-pound sack.
Reckon beans and sowbelly will do for us. They say
even game is scarce around the diggin’s.</p>

<p>“If you fellows don’t mind I believe I’ll stay around
here for a while till people cool down a little,” said the
Reverend Mr. Baxter.</p>

<p>“Cool down!” exclaimed Billy. “Huh! The
stage driver says he passed ten thousand emigrants all
heading this way!”</p>

<p>“Then I guess I won’t be missed,” laughed Mr.
Baxter.</p>

<p>“How about you, Dave?” asked Billy.</p>

<p>Davy hesitated. What the “boy” (who was a
girl) had told them rather weighed on his mind. And
the same old story of “beans and sowbelly” did not
sound inviting any longer.</p>

<p>“We saw Mr. Majors. He offered Dave a job
freighting and a pass to Leavenworth,” put in Mr.
Baxter.</p>

<p>“Take it if you want to, Dave,” said Billy, quickly.
“Life in the diggin’s will be mighty tough, but I’ve
got started and I’m going in. You do as you please.”</p>

<p>“Well,” faltered Dave, “I reckon maybe I’ll stay
out a while.”</p>

<p>“All right,” quoth Billy. “We’ll see you before
we leave. We want to pull right out, though.”</p>

<p>Nothing could stop Hi and Jim and Billy; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
sure enough that afternoon they did pull out for the
diggings forty and more miles west, among the mountains.
They settled with Mr. Baxter and Dave for
the two shares in the Hee-Haw outfit, and left with a
cheer.</p>

<p>Davy felt a momentary twinge of regret that he
was not going, too; but when he remembered what
Mr. Majors had said about “haphazard looking” and
a “bird in the hand” he decided that, after all, he
had done what was best. The work of bridging the
plains was a great work and very necessary if these
settlements at the mountains were to live.</p>

<p>“Let’s go over to Auraria and see that, Dave,”
invited Mr. Baxter. “Then we can find a place to stop
in over night. I’m tired of bedding out on the ground.”</p>

<p>Cherry Creek was almost dry. Camps and cabins
had been located right in the middle of it, so
they easily walked across. Auraria was larger than
Denver, but the buildings were not so good. They were
of rough cottonwood logs, whereas the Denver logs
were smoothed and many were of pine brought down
from the timber in the hills. Auraria had the newspaper,
the <cite>Rocky Mountain News</cite>, whose press and
type and so forth had been hauled overland by the
editor, Mr. W. N. Byers. Like Denver City, Auraria
was bustling with all kinds of people.</p>

<p>“How are you, strangers? Don’t you want to buy a
city lot and make your fortune?” invited an alert man
of the two Hee-Haws.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span></p>

<p>“What’s the price?” asked Mr. Baxter.</p>

<p>“What’ll you give? Cash or trade? The best
lots in the city. Can’t be beat.”</p>

<p>“Will you take a sack of flour?” demanded Mr.
Baxter.</p>

<p>“Done!” snapped the man. “Flour’s better than
money, friend. Where’s your flour?”</p>

<p>“Where are your lots?”</p>

<p>“Right yonder. I’ll show you.”</p>

<p>The man promptly led them on. The lots proved
to be somewhere in the midst of bare, sandy ground
half a mile out from the business street. They looked
forlorn and lonely, and Davy did not think much of
them. Neither, evidently, did Mr. Baxter. One rude
cabin stood there.</p>

<p>“Cabin too?” queried Mr. Baxter.</p>

<p>“Sure.”</p>

<p>“How many lots?”</p>

<p>“Five, my friend. Five of the finest lots in this
bustling metropolis for your sack of flour. And remember
this is Auraria; ’tain’t measley Denver. I
reckon you could buy half of Denver for your flour
and then you’d be cheated.”</p>

<p>“All right. We’ll take you, won’t we, Davy?”
responded Mr. Baxter, off-hand. “And we’ll move
right in.”</p>

<p>“Show me your flour and we’ll go to the land office
and close the deal.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span></p>

<p>So they delivered to him the flour. At the land
office the clerk asked their names.</p>

<p>“This is the Jones’ flour, Dave,” reminded Mr.
Baxter, eyeing Davy. “We’ll have that deed made out
to Jasper Jones; he’s on the way. Meanwhile we’ll
occupy the cabin.”</p>

<p>That was certainly a good scheme—besides, as
occurred to Dave, being very honest. Only it seemed
rather a high price to pay for just five lots away from
everywhere. The next time that Davy saw those lots
they were quoted at a thousand dollars apiece!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XIV">XIV<br />
<small>DAVY SIGNS AS “EXTRA”</small></h2>
</div>


<p>One more day in Denver and Auraria satisfied
Dave. He had seen about all there was to see, and had
loafed long enough. He wanted to go to work. However,
many other people wanted to go to work, too.
But work was scarce and money scarcer, and provisions
were tremendously high. Travellers were constantly
coming back from the mountains with tales of
woe and with empty pockets and sore feet. The
great editor, Horace Greeley, had advised people to
plant crops; then he had continued on west, for California.
But the people were bent on getting rich all
at once by mining instead of waiting for crops. This
made the situation bad, especially for a boy.</p>

<p>“You’d better take the stage back to-morrow,
Dave,” counselled Mr. Baxter. “I’ll see you later.”</p>

<p>“Guess I will, then,” said Dave. “What will you
do, though?” For he did not like to desert his
partner.</p>

<p>“Oh,” laughed Mr. Baxter, “there’s a good living
in hauling timber in from the foothills. Another fellow
has offered to furnish the team and do the hauling
if I’ll do the chopping. But that’s no life for a boy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
Dave. You’ll learn more, freighting out of Leavenworth;
and then you can go to school in the winter.
See?”</p>

<p>That sounded sensible. Thus the Hee-Haw outfit
had divided: Billy Cody and Hi and Jim and Left-over
mining; Mr. Baxter cutting timber, and Davy freighting
across the plains. Such was life in the busy West.</p>

<p>Davy engaged passage in the next morning’s
Leavenworth &amp; Pike’s Peak stage, east bound to the
States. It had taken the Hee-Haw outfit forty days
to come out; now Davy was going back in six. This
was luxury. The coach held six passengers, with one
on the seat. There was a school-teacher from Vermont,
a merchant from Ohio, a banker from Chicago,
an army officer from Fort Leavenworth, a man and
wife from Boston, and Davy. All, except Davy, had
been to the “diggin’s”—and the Ohio merchant let slip
the fact that he had located a good claim there where
he and his partner were washing out two hundred dollars
a day! So he was returning for his family.</p>

<p>Yes, it was an interesting company; but as best
of all, the driver was Hank Bassett!</p>

<p>“Why, hello!” greeted Hank of Dave. “Bully
for you. Get up here on the seat. I’ll take you
through in style.”</p>

<p>“I engaged that seat,” objected the school-teacher.</p>

<p>“Not much,” retorted Hank. “It’ll make you
seasick. I can have what I want in this seat; and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
boy rides there. I can depend on him if I need a hand,
and that’s very important, mister.”</p>

<p>“You know him, do you?”</p>

<p>“You’re right I know him. We’ve worked together
before, haven’t we, Dave?”</p>

<p>Davy blushed, somewhat embarrassed by Hank’s
hearty manner; but Hank had ordered, and Hank was
boss, and Dave climbed to the seat beside him.</p>

<p>With crack of whip and cheer from the crowd
gathered to watch, at a gallop out surged the four
mules for the nigh seven hundred miles to the Missouri
River and the States. Davy thoroughly enjoyed that
trip. Hank sent his mules forward at a rattling pace;
for, as he explained, he changed teams at every station,
eighteen or twenty miles apart. Night and day the
stage travelled, making its one hundred miles each
twenty-four hours, halting only to change teams and
for meals.</p>

<p>And night and day the Pike’s Peak pilgrims were
in sight. The westward travel was even more pronounced
than earlier in the year, when the Hee-Haws
had joined in it. There were new signs, too, on the
wagons. “Bound for the Land of Gold.” “Family
Express; Milk for Sale!” “Mind Your Own Business.”
“We Are Off for the Peak. Are You?”
“Hooray for the Diggin’s!” These and other announcements
Davy read on the prairie schooners as the
hurrying stage passed.</p>

<p>“Horace Greeley, the New York editor, wrote<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
back east that the Pike’s Peak country is O. K.,” said
Hank to Davy. “That’s what’s set the tide flowin’ in
earnest. People were waitin’ to get his opinion. He
inspected the diggin’s, and he says the gold is thar—although
most people would do better to take up land
in Kansas and go to farmin’. If you call this trail a
busy one you ought to see the Salt Lake Overland Trail
up the Platte. I hear three hundred wagons a day
pass Fort Kearney. This booms the freightin’ business.
The old man (Hank meant Mr. Majors) and
his pards are puttin’ on every team they can lay hands
to for haulin’ goods an’ provisions. Why, this hyar
stage line is usin’ a thousand mules and fifty coaches.
You’re thinkin’ of bull whackin’, are you?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Majors offered me a job,” answered Davy.</p>

<p>Hank spat over the lines.</p>

<p>“It’s a good firm to work for,” he said. “And a
man’s job. After you’ve bull whacked a while you’ll
be drivin’ stage like I am.”</p>

<p>That sounded attractive. To handle four mules at
a gallop, dragging a coach across the plains in spite of
Indians and weather, appeared quite a feat. Driving
stage meant taking care of people as well as of animals.</p>

<p>However, holding up one’s end with a freight outfit
was not to be despised, these days. On arriving at
Leavenworth Davy lost no time in reporting at the
Russell, Majors &amp; Waddell office. Mr. Majors was
not here. He had removed his family up to Nebraska
City, on the Missouri above Leavenworth, where a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
branch office had been established in order to relieve
the crowded state of the Leavenworth shipping yards.
However, if Mr. Majors was gone, here was Mr. Russell,
as snappy and alert as ever, taking care of whatever
came his way.</p>

<p>“All right, my boy,” he greeted promptly. “If
you want a job you’re just in time. When did you
get in?”</p>

<p>“This noon, Mr. Russell.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you’re ready to start back again for
the mountains?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Good. We’ve got a train made up to leave in
about an hour. Charley Martin’s wagon master.
You’ll find him a fine fellow. He comes from a wealthy
family in my home town, Lexington, Missouri. You’ll
be an ‘extra’ at forty dollars a month, and have a
mule to ride. I expect you to do as well as Billy Cody’s
done. You know what your duties are, do you?
You’ll act as the wagon master’s orderly, or messenger,
to carry word along the line; and if necessary
you’ll fill the place of any hand who’s sick. Let’s see—you
signed the pledge once, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Russell.”</p>

<p>“Well, we changed that pledge a little to make it
stronger. Mr. Majors has drawn up a new one. Read
it before you sign,” and Mr. Russell reached out his
tanned, freckled hand for a pad of printed forms.</p>

<p>Davy read: “I, ——, do hereby swear, before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
the Great and Living God, that during my engagement
and while I am in the employ of Russell, Majors &amp;
Waddell, I will, under no circumstances, use profane
language; that I will drink no intoxicating liquors; that
I will not quarrel or fight with any other employe of
the firm, and that in every respect I will conduct myself
honestly, be faithful to my duties, and so direct
all my acts as to win the confidence and esteem of my
employers. So help me God.”</p>

<p>This was an impressive promise, but it sounded
just like the strict and Christian Mr. Majors. Dave
had no hesitation in signing it.</p>

<p>“All right,” crisply approved Mr. Russell. “If
you keep that pledge you’ll never be far wrong. Here’s
your Bible. To every man employed in our trains we
give a Bible. There’s no time or place when the Bible
isn’t a help and a comfort. The more of them we get
on the plains the better. Now I’m going out to the
camp. You come along and I’ll start you off.”</p>

<p>Davy tucked the compact little leather-bound Bible
into his pocket, and followed Mr. Russell’s wiry active
figure out of the door. Russell, Majors &amp; Waddell
certainly organized their business on somewhat unusual
lines; Davy had heard the pledge and the Bible
both laughed at by outsiders as being foolishness for
running bull trains. But nobody was enabled to point
out the harm done, and few denied that considerable
good might result. At any rate, no better bull outfits
crossed the plains than those of Russell, Majors &amp;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
Waddell. They did what no other outfits could do;
nothing stopped them.</p>

<p>The streets of Leavenworth were busier than ever,
with emigrants, teamsters, rivermen, soldiers, and Indians—Kickapoos,
Osages and Pottawattamies; with
wagons, oxen, mules and horses. The company’s
freight trains were started from a large camp on the
outskirts of town. Hither Mr. Russell, with Davy in
tow, hastened.</p>

<p>Charley Martin was speedily found working hard—together
with the assistant wagon master, who was
nicknamed “Yank.”</p>

<p>“Here’s your ‘extra,’ Charley,” announced Mr.
Russell.</p>

<p>Charley paused and wiped his forehead. He gazed,
rather puzzled.</p>

<p>“What name does he go by, Mr. Russell?”</p>

<p>“Davy Scott.”</p>

<p>“Sometimes they call me ‘Red,’ too,” volunteered
Davy.</p>

<p>Charley Martin smiled; and when he smiled, Davy
instantly liked him.</p>

<p>“Oho! This must be Billy Cody’s pard on the trail
and at the Cody home, I reckon. I’ve heard about him,
but I never had the pleasure of meeting him. You
must have been growing some, haven’t you, Red? I
thought you were a runt.” And Davy fidgeted, embarrassed.
During his sturdy life in the open air he
had indeed been growing; he had shot up and broadened<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
out, and had acquired a steady eye and a manner
of self-reliance. “Where’ve you been keeping yourself
lately?” continued Charley.</p>

<p>“I’ve just got back from Pike’s Peak.”</p>

<p>“Good for you. Well, if you’ve travelled with
Billy Cody, and Mr. Russell recommends you, too,
you’ll do.” And Charley called to his assistant:
“Here’s our ‘extra,’ Yank.”</p>

<p>Charley was small and compact, tanned and gray-eyed,
and so quick and cheery that anybody felt like
calling him by his first name at once. “Yank,” the
assistant wagon boss, was high-shouldered, long-legged,
slouchy, and very different from Charley. His
sullen face was bristly with carroty stubble, his eyes
were small and close together, and his lips were thin
and hard-set, leaking tobacco-juice. Him, Davy did
not fancy at all; and by his glance and contemptuous
grunt he evidently did not fancy Davy.</p>

<p>Further exchange of conversation was interrupted
by the incisive voice of Mr. Russell reproving a teamster
who had a perverse ox in hand.</p>

<p>“My man, don’t you understand there’s to be no
cursing while you’re working for this company?”</p>

<p>“I’m not cursing,” retorted the man, with a dreadful
oath.</p>

<p>“But you’re cursing right this minute!” asserted
Mr. Russell, sharply.</p>

<p>“I’m not, either,” answered the man, with another
oath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span></p>

<p>“Why, you curse every time you open your
mouth,” asserted Mr. Russell, red with anger.</p>

<p>“I don’t,” insisted the man, as before.</p>

<p>That was too much for Mr. Russell. As if not
knowing quite what to do with such an ignoramus as
this he walked off, scratching his head, and left the
puzzled teamster scratching his.</p>

<p>“Well, Red, get busy if you’re to travel with this
outfit,” bade Charley to Davy; and proceeded to give
orders right and left.</p>

<p>The train was made up and almost ready to start.
The last covers were being drawn taut, and the last
wagon, which had been delayed to load in town, was
approaching.</p>

<p>“All set?” shouted Charley to the teamster who,
standing beside the rear pair of his team, seemed to
have been appointed as the leader.</p>

<p>The teamster nodded.</p>

<p>“All set.”</p>

<p>“String out,” ordered Charley, and the word was
carried along: “String out, boys! Fall in!”</p>

<p>The lead teamster flung his lash; it flipped forward
and cracked like a pistol-shot over the backs of
his twelve oxen.</p>

<p>“Spot! Dandy! Yip! Yip with you!”</p>

<p>The twelve oxen lunged all together as a well-trained
team; and creaking, the huge wagon rolled
ahead.</p>

<p>“Haw! Whoa—haw! Hep! Hep!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span></p>

<p>To the shouts, and the volley of whip-snappers, the
grunts of the oxen, creakings of the wagons and yokes,
and rattle of the ox-chains, the train uncoiled from
the mass that it had formed and lengthened out into a
long line. Led by that first teamster whose “bulls,”
sleek-coated, evidently were his pride, the white-topped
bull train stretched out for the farther West.</p>

<p>Charley, the wagon master, rode well up with the
leading team, and Davy, his assistant, as his aide or
orderly, rode at his elbow ready for orders. Yank,
assistant wagon master, was down the line. At the
rear, behind the few loose cattle taken along for use in
case of accidents, rode on a mule the “cavvy” herder—a
young Eastern chap who was Mr. Waddell’s
nephew and wanted to learn plains life. “Cavvy” of
course was the short for “cavvy-yard,” and “cavvy-yard”
was the slang for “caballada,” Spanish of
“horse-herd.”</p>

<p>There were twenty-six wagons in the train: twenty-five
loaded with freight and one mess-wagon carrying
the supplies. They were enormous wagons, some of
them seventeen feet long, the broad boxes five or six
feet deep, the great wheels wide tired; and over all a
flaring hood of canvas labelled “Osnaburg” (the
trademark of the famous mills which furnished most
of the duck and sheeting used on the plains), stretched
upon bows, nailed fast at the edges to the wagon-box,
but at either end puckered tight by draw ropes, leaving
an oblong hole. As Davy knew, the wheels, axles and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
other running gear were the very best of wood. Even
the ends of the axles, on which fitted the wheels, were
wood. The wheels were held on by an iron linch-pin
thrust through the axle outside the hub. These wooden
axles on the sandy, dusty plains required much greasing,
and from the rear axle of each wagon hung a pot
of tar for greasing. On the reach-pole, which was the
pole projecting from underneath the box, out behind
the wagon, was slung a ten-gallon keg of water.</p>

<p>Each wagon was drawn by twelve oxen, yoked together
in six pairs. This was the regular fashion;
twenty-five freight wagons to a train, and six yoke of
bulls to a wagon. There were thirty-one men in the
outfit: a teamster for each of the twenty-six wagons,
the wagon master and the assistant wagon master, Davy
the “extra” another “extra” (who was a regular
teamster), and the cavvy herder. The teamsters
trudged beside their teams; the only persons who rode
were Charley and Yank and Davy and the cavvy
herder, on their mules.</p>

<p>The freight train was called a “bull train”; the
wagons were “bull wagons”; the oxen were “bull
teams”; the teamsters were “bull whackers”; the
wagon master was the “bull wagon boss”; and the
whole array was a “bull outfit.”</p>

<p>Stretched out in a line a quarter of a mile long, the
train made a handsome sight to Davy, proudly looking
back from his post at the flank of Charley’s mule.
The oxen, fresh for the start, with heads low and necks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
fitted into great wooden yoke and bow, pulled stanchly,
at a dignified, steady plod, keeping the heavy ox-chains
tight. The majority of the “bulls” were spotted white
and red or black; there were a number of roans and
reds and a few black. The head team were black,
except the pair next to the wagon, which were red.
Several had been dehorned because they were
fighters.</p>

<p>The teamsters strode sturdily, cracking their whips,
shouting to their teams and to one another, and occasionally
singing. One and all wore neither coat nor
vest, but heavy flannel shirt of red or blue, and a silk
or cotton handkerchief about the neck. Their shirts
were tucked into coarse trousers, and the trousers into
high, stout cowhide boots. On their heads were the
regular broad-brimmed, flat-crowned felt hats that
plains travellers liked best. About the waists of the
most of the men were strapped one or two big Colt’s
revolvers, and through the belt was thrust a butcher-knife.
They all had a gun somewhere, either belted
on or else as a yager or a rifle stowed handily in the
wagon. And every teamster carried, trailing or coiled,
his long-lashed whip.</p>

<p>The train was, as Charley remarked roundly to
Dave, “a crack outfit.”</p>

<p>“We’ve got some of the top-notcher teams and
whackers of the whole Russell, Majors &amp; Waddell concern,”
he said. “There’s not a better bull-whip slinger<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
or a better six yoke of bulls on the trail than right
here with this lead wagon. Of course, I suppose we’ve
some crooked sticks, like every train has; but they’ve
got to behave themselves while I’m boss.”</p>

<p>The train was bound for Denver by the regular
Overland Trail up the Platte River, through central
Nebraska. The Government road from Leavenworth,
to strike the main trail, was that travelled road which
crossed the Salt Creek Valley; Davy seized the chance
to dart aside for a moment and say “how-de-do” to
Mother Cody and the girls. He gave them what word
he could of Billy, but they gave him none, for they
had not had time to hear from Billy since he had
reached the diggings.</p>

<p>The bull train toiled on over the hill and out of the
valley. Now it was fairly launched upon its day-by-day
journey of 700 miles. It did not travel alone.
The trail before and behind was alive with other outfits,
chiefly emigrants, likewise bound for the “Peak,”
and Charley asserted that when the main trail was
entered, at Fort Kearney, where the travel from
Omaha and St. Joe and Nebraska City joined with the
travel from Leavenworth, there’d scarcely be room to
camp!</p>

<p>“How long will we be on the road, do you think?”
asked Dave.</p>

<p>“Leavenworth to Denver? About fifty days if we
have reasonable luck. The trail’s so crowded and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
dusty and fodder’s so scarce I don’t reckon we’ll average
more than twelve miles a day. We’re hauling
seventy hundred pounds in some of those wagons.
But I have averaged fifteen miles a day; and travelling
empty a smart bull train headed for home can make
twenty.”</p>

<p>It now was past midsummer; it would be fall when
the train reached the mountains, and winter before it
got home again.</p>

<small>FREIGHTING ACROSS THE PLAINS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Do you know,” drawled Charley Martin, lazily,
after supper this evening, “there’s a heap of money
wrapped up in one of these bull outfits?”</p>

<p>They had made camp at sunset—and the sight had
been an inspiring one. On order from Charley, the
lead wagon had turned from the trail and halted; the
second wagon had pulled up opposite and also halted;
the third wagon had halted behind the first, a little
outside of it, with tongue pointing out and the fore
wheels about on a line with the other wagon’s rear
wheels. The fourth wagon had halted in similar position
behind the second wagon. And so forth. Each
wagon widened the circle until it was time for them
to begin to edge the other way and narrow the circle.
At the last the circle was complete, save for an opening
at either end. When the ox-chains had been linked
from wagon-wheel to next wagon-wheel then the bull
corral, as it was called, was finished. Or, no; after
the bulls had been unyoked and driven to water and
pasture each wagon tongue was hung off the ground,
slung in the draw ropes of the front end of the hood.
This weight kept the canvas hood pulled taut in case
of storm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span></p>

<p>It took considerable skill in driving to swing the
long bull teams and land the wagons just right to form
the corral. Yes, and the animals needed to be well
trained, too. By the way that all went to work this
wagon outfit knew their business.</p>

<p>The corral was useful for yoking the bulls and for
standing off Indians. No Indians dared to charge a
wagon corral when the men inside it had guns and
ammunition.</p>

<p>The bulls were put out to pasture in charge of two
teamsters selected as herders. The men had been
divided into four messes. Each mess chose a cook and
their water carrier and fuel gatherers and guards—when
guard was needed. Davy was in Captain Charley’s
mess, which consisted of Charley and Yank, Davy,
the cavvy herder, the lead teamster, whose name was
Joel Badger, and the extra teamster, Henry Renick,
who did the cooking. This was the smallest mess.</p>

<p>Each mess had its fire, about which the men
lounged after eating, to smoke their pipes and joke and
tell stories.</p>

<p>“Yes, siree; there’s a lot of money wrapped up in
a bull outfit,” quoth Wagon Boss Charley. “Take
this train here. The most of those wagons are ‘Murphies’
(by which he meant wagons manufactured
by J. Murphy, of St. Louis), or else the Conestoga
pattern built down at Westport (and by Westport
was meant Kansas City). Only the best of stuff
goes into those wagons. Hickory, generally—though<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
osage orange is said to be better, for it won’t warp.
But second growth hickory and sound white oak answer
the purpose if they’re so well seasoned that they
won’t shrink or warp. This dry air out on these plains
plays the dickens with wheels; it saps them dry and
makes them so they want to fall to pieces. Well, I
reckon you all know this better than I do. But as I
was going to say, one of these wagons figures easily
three hundred dollars, including bows and canvas.
Then, bulls have been seventy-five dollars a yoke, but
they’re rising to double that. Taking the six yoke at
five hundred dollars, and adding the yokes and bows
and chains and other gear, you’ll have nigh to a
thousand dollars in each wagon outfit. With twenty-five
and twenty-six wagons making a train there’s
twenty-five thousand dollars in outfit alone. And Russell,
Majors &amp; Waddell have bull trains like this every
five or six miles clear across from the Missouri River
to Salt Lake!”</p>

<p>“Not to speak of the wages of the men and the cost
of the supplies,” added Joel Badger.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; not to mention the thirty or more men
with every train at a dollar a day up; and the beans
and flour and sowbelly and coffee they use.”</p>

<p>“Just the same,” observed Joel, “I hear that in
Fifty-six, before Waddell joined, Majors &amp; Russell
cleaned up about seventy thousand dollars with three
hundred wagons at work.”</p>

<p>Charley nodded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span></p>

<p>“You can sum up for yourself. We’re hauling
flour at nine cents a pound, meat at fifteen cents, furniture
at thirty cents, hardware at ten cents; and my waybill
shows we’re loaded with one hundred and sixty-three
thousand pounds of freight, averaging, I reckon,
at least fifteen cents.”</p>

<p>“Which totals up between twenty-five and twenty-six
thousand dollars, as I make it,” proffered Joel.</p>

<p>“Of course, the outfits don’t earn that both ways,”
reminded Henry Renick, scouring a skillet. “They
travel back empty.”</p>

<p>“Well, twenty-five thousand dollars for the round
trip to the mountains isn’t so bad,” said Charley.</p>

<p>“No,” grunted Yank, the assistant wagon boss.
“Russell, Majors &amp; Waddell are makin’ their profits,
all right. They can sit at home an’ take things easy.
But the trail’s a hard life for the rest of us.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you believe they take it easy,” retorted
Charley. “Did you ever hear of Alex Majors taking
it easy? And look at Billy Russell, with all the Leavenworth
freighting on his shoulders. Besides, they know
that one big blizzard or one Indian war would wipe
them out in spite of their hustle. No; they’ve got the
worry; we’ve got the picnic.”</p>

<p>“’Twould serve ’em right if they did get wiped out
once in a while,” growled Yank, who evidently was as
narrow-minded as his eyes indicated. “That psalm-singin’
old whiskers has too many notions. No
swearin’, no drinkin’ no bull skinnin’, no fightin’, every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
man read the Bible an’ lay up on Sunday! An outfit
can’t do freightin’ on these plains an’ follow any such
rules as those.”</p>

<p>“See here,” bade Charley, sternly. He was a gritty
little chap. “You’re new amongst us, my man, and
I’ll warn you that when you speak to us of Mr. Majors
or Mr. Russell or Mr. Waddell either, you want to do
it civilly. They may have their peculiar notions of
how to run a bull outfit, but I notice they’ve made good
already with about twenty million pounds of Government
freight, and that’s a pretty big contract. They’re
a firm whose word is equal to a United States banknote;
and there’s not a man who ever worked for them
that won’t stick up for Russell, Majors &amp; Waddell.
A kinder man than Mr. Majors never lived; and if he
tries to spread a little Christianity along the trail all
the more credit to him, and all the better for the rest
of us. We need some of that out here. The fact is
a Russell, Majors &amp; Waddell bull train is the best on
the trail, besides being decent.”</p>

<p>“Well,” rapped Yank, “as long as I do the work
I’m hired to do I’ll allow no man to tell me how to act.
When I signed that pledge for the whiskers outfit I
didn’t mean to keep it an’ I sha’n’t if I don’t choose.”</p>

<p>He stalked off; they gazed after—Charley with a
keen glint in his gray eyes.</p>

<p>“There’s a man” spoke Henry the mess cook,
“who’ll take it out on animals when he gets mad.
He’s just mean enough.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span></p>

<p>“He’ll not take it out on my team,” remarked Joel,
quietly. “I don’t whip my bulls.”</p>

<p>“No, nor on mine,” asserted Henry.</p>

<p>“Anybody who thinks he has to beat bulls to drive
them doesn’t know how to drive,” added Charley.</p>

<p>That night they all slept on the ground under
blankets and quilts and buffalo robes; many of the men
slept beneath their wagons. The neck-yokes of the
oxen, with an overcoat folded into the hollow of the
curve in them, made comfortable pillows. At least so
Davy found his when, to be a veteran bull whacker, he
borrowed a yoke and tried. Two men at a time night-herded
the cattle. Davy, being an “extra,” did not
go on herd yet.</p>

<p>The mess cooks were up at dawn preparing breakfast;
and speedily the collection of little camps was
astir. The men called back and forth, washed at the
nearby creek, brought water in buckets, and what fuel
they found, and were ready for breakfast when breakfast
was ready for them. The company, Davy learned,
furnished everything, even to the gunny sacking in
which buffalo chips and bull chips were gathered;
everything except the men’s revolvers. These the men
owned.</p>

<p>By the time that the breakfasts were over the cattle
had been driven, with shouts and crack of whip, into
the wagon corral, where under a dust cloud they stood
grunting and jostling. Yank posted himself at one
gap of the corral Charley at the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span></p>

<p>“Catch up! Catch up, boys!” called Charley, the
wagon boss; the cry was repeated, and the men sprang
to their yokes. Every man with his yoke on his shoulder,
a yoke pin in his hand, another in his mouth, and
an ox-bow slung on his arm, the gang poured into the
corral. It was an interesting sight, and a number of
emigrants who had camped near gathered to witness.</p>

<p>There was a rivalry among the men as to which
should yoke up first. Davy wondered how they found
their bulls so readily; but in rapid succession every
man, working hard, had yoke and bows on a pair of
his team, and led them forth to his wagon. First the
yoke was laid over the neck of a bull, the bow was
slipped under and the pins thrust in to fasten bow to
yoke; then the other bull was yoked; and this done,
dragging the chains they were led out in a hurry.
This pair, Davy saw, were the wheel team—the team
next to the wagon. They supported the wagon pole,
which hung in a ring riveted to the centre of the yoke.
As soon as the wheel teams were hitched to the wagon
the men hastened to yoke and lead out the lead teams,
which were the teams at the other end of the six.
Then the space was filled in by the four other teams,
all the chains were hooked, the men straightened out
their six yoke, and the train was ready to move.</p>

<p>It all had been done, as Davy thought, very quickly;
but Joel Badger, whom Davy liked exceedingly, thought
differently.</p>

<p>“We make rather a botch of it at first,” said Joel,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
as beside his fine team he stood, whip in hand, waiting
for the word to start. “Some of the bulls are sure
to be green or ornery, and not used to their drivers or
each other. After they have pulled together for a
time all the bulls in each team will sorter flock in a
bunch, in the corral, and a fellow won’t have to hunt
through the herd. You’ll see some fast work before
you get to the end of the trail.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t the mules as good as bulls?” queried
Davy.</p>

<p>“No. They used to have mules and mule skinners
instead of bull whackers down on the Santa Fe Trail,
and I reckon they’ve used ’em on the Overland Trail,
too. Bulls are better all ’round. They can walk as
fast as a mule if they’re pushed; they can live on grazing
that a mule can’t; and they’re not so liable to be
stampeded. If Injuns run off any cattle we can overtake
’em by mule or horse and fetch ’em back. No,
for freight hauling the bulls are the best. Those used
down on the southern trails are Texas cattle largely;
small-bodied kind, with flaring big horns. These we
use in the north, on the Overland Trail, are some Durhams,
some Herefords, and so on. I reckon I’ve got
about the best team in the outfit; they’re black Galloways,
with a yoke of red Devons.”</p>

<p>“Line out, men! Hep!” called Wagon Boss
Charley.</p>

<p>Joel launched his whip with a tremendous crack
above the backs of his team.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span></p>

<p>“Haw, Buck! Muley! Spot! Yip! Yip!”</p>

<p>“Haw! Whoa—gee! Yip! Yip! Hep!” The
air was full of dust and shouts and cracking of whips;
and one after another out for the trail rolled the huge
wagons, until the circle of the corral had straightened
into the day’s line.</p>

<p>The teamsters walked at the left side of their teams
until, when the wind began to blow the dust into their
faces, they changed about to the clear side. They
sang, they joked, occasionally they cracked their long
whips, and now and then one perched sideways on the
wagon-pole behind the wheel yoke, and swinging his
legs rode a short distance. But nobody entered a
wagon; the men either walked or sat on the pole for a
brief rest.</p>

<p>Charley, the wagon boss, kept position near the
head of the column; Yank, the assistant wagon boss,
usually was found at the rear. Davy sometimes was
sent back with word from Charley; and once he was
dispatched five miles ahead to take a message to another
wagon train. He enjoyed these gallops over the
prairie on official business, and he enjoyed riding with
Charley.</p>

<p>“I suppose you know the make-up of a team,”
proffered Charley, who seemed disposed to teach Dave
as much as he could. “The first yoke next to the
wagon are the wheel yoke; sometimes we call them
the pole yoke. The other yokes are the swing yokes,
until you come to the leaders, and these are the lead<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
yoke. In a mule team the middle or swing spans are
the pointers. Fact is, a four-span mule team is divided
into wheelers, swing team, pointers and lead team.
You didn’t time us this morning, did you?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” confessed Davy.</p>

<p>“I hear Mr. Majors timed his outfit once, when it
was in good trim; and it was sixteen minutes from the
moment the men grabbed their yokes until the teams
were hitched and the train was ready to start. That’s
pretty fair for six yoke of bulls. I don’t believe we
can beat it, but we’re going to try after a bit.”</p>

<p>“This noon I’ll show you how to pop a whip,”
called Joel to Dave.</p>

<p>The men used their whips chiefly for the noise they
made. They drove with the whips; the long lash flew
out over the backs of the six yoke and seemed to crack
wherever the wielder wished it to crack. Sometimes
it barely flicked the back of some ox who required a
little urging, but it never landed hard. Those bull
whips were like living things, and in the hands of
Joel and his rivals were as accurate as a rifle. The most
of the men carried their whips with the lash trailing
over their shoulder ready to be jerked forward like a
cowboy’s rope. Dave felt a burning ambition to
“pop” a whip. It must be quite an art.</p>

<p>The trail continued to be lined with emigrants, all
pushing west, the vast majority for the “Pike’s Peak
diggin’s,” but a few for California by way of the
Overland Trail to Fort Laramie, and on over the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
South Pass to Salt Lake and the farthest West. The
road was littered with cast-off stuff—so much of it
that nobody seemed to think it worth picking up again.</p>

<p>“Great times for the Indians,” quoth Charley.
“But they don’t savvy stoves and furniture yet. What
they like most is the hoop iron off of the baled hay
that the Government sends out to the posts. That
hoop iron is fine for arrow points; many a poor fellow
crossing the plains is killed with Government hoop-iron.”</p>

<p>“Will we meet many Indians, do you think?” asked
Davy.</p>

<p>Charley shook his head.</p>

<p>“We may meet a few gangs of beggars; but the
trail is too thick just now for much trouble. The Indians
haven’t got roused yet and started in on the
war-path. But they will, later. I reckon if you get
off the trail a ways you’ll meet with plenty trouble,
though. On the trail there are so many outfits that
they can help each other, you see. The Indians are
learning to shy off from bull outfits. We’re ready for
them any time, and it costs them too many scalps.
But when these plains begin to be settled with ranches
then look out for the Indians.”</p>

<p>That noon the train halted on the far side of a
creek. According to Joel, trains always tried to cross
a creek before camping, in case a sudden storm might
come and hold the train back by swelling the ford.
They corralled, this noon, by a new evolution. One-half<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
the train, in regular order, formed a half of the
circle; the other half then formed the second half of
the circle. This was called corralling with the right
and left wings.</p>

<p>While dinner was being cooked and the bulls were
herded off to water and graze, the men lounged in the
shade of their wagons. Dinner was the same as supper
and breakfast: fat salt pork or “sowbelly,” which came
to the plate in slabs six or eight inches thick; hot bread
baked in the kettle-like Dutch ovens; beans from the
supply baked in the ashes the night before; and black
coffee with sugar. That was the regulation until the
buffalo and antelope country was reached. The last of
the sugar was used, too; after this camp, all the way
to Denver the coffee would be sugarless. But that was
only ordinary. Nobody objected to the menu; appetites
were splendid.</p>

<p>“Here,” spoke Joel, after dinner, rising, to Dave.
“I said I’d show you how to pop a whip, didn’t I?”</p>

<p>“Joel can do it, all right,” approved Charley; and
several other men nodded, agreeing with him.</p>

<p>And Bull Whacker Joel could. A heavy thing was
that whip; the lash, of braided buffalo hide, was
eighteen feet long and thick like a snake in the middle.
It had a cracker of buck-skin, six inches long, split at the
end; and a hickory stock eighteen inches long. Joel
said it cost eighteen dollars in Leavenworth. Flicking
it forward, from where it trailed on the ground, he
landed the tip wherever he wished. With the cracker<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
he picked up small objects at the full extent of the lash;
he snipped the tips from the sage and cut blossoms;
and how he “popped”!</p>

<p>“He’s a boss bull-whip slinger,” laughed Charley,
approvingly. “You’ll never see a better one to pick
flies off the lead team.”</p>

<p>“I’ve seen others,” uttered Yank, who somehow
appeared to have a grudge against the train. “These
fancy tricks will do for show, but give me the man who
can spot a bull twenty feet off an’ take a piece of hide
out with the cracker. I don’t want no fancy fly-killer
in my train. Bull whips are made for business.”</p>

<p>“You don’t want bull whackers; you want
butchers,” retorted Joel, contemptuously. “Here,
Dave, try your luck. Give him room, boys.”</p>

<p>Dave tried, but the long lash on the short handle
proved a queer thing to handle. It persisted in flying
crooked or falling short, and several times he almost
hanged himself or narrowly escaped losing an ear.
However, before he surrendered the whip to Joel he
had got the knack of popping it; that was something.</p>

<p>“Hurray!” encouraged Joel. “We’ll make a bull
whacker of you before the end of this trip. You’ll
be able to pop a whip with the best of us.”</p>

<p>Davy scarcely expected this skill; but he was resolved
to do so well that he could show Billy Cody.</p>

<small>YANK RAISES TROUBLE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The bull train plodded on and on, day by day,
across the rolling prairies, whose soil, black, made
blackish dust. One day was much like another. The
principal excitement was the passing of the stages.
The Leavenworth &amp; Pike’s Peak Express Company had
changed from the Smoky Hill route to Denver, and
were running on the famous Platte trail now: by the
Government road from Leavenworth to the Platte at
Fort Kearney, thence up the Platte and the South
Platte—the same road that the bull train was taking.</p>

<p>Regularly once a day the stage from the east and
the stage from the west passed the train, which, like
everything else, drew aside at the sign of the well-known
dust ahead or behind, and with wave of whip
and shout of voice greeted the flight of the four mules
and the heavy coach. At gallop or brisk trot the stage
swept by—the driver scarcely deigning a glance at bull
whackers—and disappeared in its own cloud.</p>

<p>For the bull train there were two halts each day:
at noon and at evening, when the wagons were corralled,
usually by the right and left wing, the oxen
unyoked, and camp made for rest and meals. Then,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
about one o’clock and about six in the morning, the
march was resumed. The men walked beside their
wheel cattle and by stepping out a little and “throwing”
the whip to the full extent of lash, stock and arm,
they could flick the backs of their lead cattle.</p>

<p>However, they rarely needed to use the whip as a
punishment. The whole train maintained the pace set
by Joel’s lead team and followed that. Each team kept
close behind the wagon in front of them, so that the
lead yoke’s noses almost touched the rear end. It was
a close formation, preserved by the bulls themselves
without urging. The teamsters really had little to
do while on the level trail. But when the trail was
very soft, or creeks or gullies had to be crossed, then
there was work for all. Sometimes the teams were
doubled, until ten or twelve yoke of bulls were
stretched as one team, hauling the heavy wagons across
in turn.</p>

<p>It was a great sight—the long line of panting,
puffing oxen, with nostrils wide and eyes bulging and
muscles of neck and back knotted, tugging all together,
while the whips cracked and the men shouted,
and slowly the huge white-topped wagon, swaying and
creaking, and weighing, with its load, five tons or more,
rolled onward out of difficulty.</p>

<p>At such times Davy felt like giving the sweaty bulls
a cheer.</p>

<p>In the morning early, before the sun blazed and the
dust and wind gathered, the plains were wonderfully<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
peaceful, and in the clear air the flowers seemed many
and the antelope and rabbits and prairie dogs more
lively. In the evening the men joked and told stories
and sang songs around their camp-fire ashes. The
favorite songs appeared to be one called “Days of
Forty-nine,” another called “Betsy From Pike,” and
another called “Joe Bowers.” This was a very long
song, especially when the men made up verses to fit it.
Charley said that anybody could begin it at Leavenworth
and end it at the mountains. But the song that
Davy liked the best was sung by “Sailor Bill,” one of
the bull whackers. It was “The Bay of Biscay, O!”
and in a deep bass voice Bill sang it finely, because he
had been a sailor:</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Loud roared the dreadful thunder,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">The rain a deluge show’rs;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The clouds were rent asunder</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">By lightning’s vivid pow’rs.</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">The night both drear and dark</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">Our poor devoted bark,</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">Till next day</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">There she lay,</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">In the Bay of Biscay O!</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>It was a strange song to sing out here in the midst
of the dry plains; but with Bill booming and his comrades
joining in the chorus it sounded particularly
good.</p>

<p>The trail was divided off by various names, as city
blocks are divided off by streets. Most of the men
could call the route by heart. There was Salt Creek<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
and Grasshopper Creek and Walnut Creek and Elm
Creek and the Big Blue, and the Big and Little Sandy,
and Ash Point and the Little Blue and Thirty-two Mile
Creek and Sand Hill Pond and the Platte River and
then Fort Kearney, where, 294 miles from Leavenworth,
the main Overland Trail to Denver and Salt
Lake was struck.</p>

<p>On the Little Blue, before reaching Fort Kearney,
the train had its first accident—and a peculiar accident
that was. Davy first learned of it when, as he came
riding back from an errand for Charley to another
train behind, he saw a wagon at the middle of his train
pull short and heard a shout and saw teamsters, their
teams also halted, go running to the place.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter? Rattlers?” This was the
first thought—that the teamster had been bitten by a
rattlesnake.</p>

<p>“No. Somebody run over!”</p>

<p>The rear half of the train had stopped, of course;
the fore half, after pulling on a little way, also had
stopped. Charley came galloping back, Yank galloped
forward, and so did Davy. The men ahead had
gathered in a group and were carrying something out
from under the wagons. It was Sailor Bill, poor fellow.
He had been riding sitting on the pole of his
wagon behind his wheel yoke, and he must have
dozed, for he had fallen off and the wheels of his
wagon had passed over him.</p>

<p>“My old lead bulls snorted and jumped like as if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
they’d stepped on a rattler,” was explaining the teamster
who had shouted and halted his team. “I thought
it <em>was</em> a rattler, of course; but when I looked I saw
<em>him</em>! Right under my second swing team’s hoofs!
But he was done breathing before ever we got to him.
I’m sartin of that. His own wagon did for him; and
mighty quick.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” they all nodded soberly, “poor Bill like as
not never knew what was happening to him.”</p>

<p>“Anybody know who his folks are or where?” demanded
Charley.</p>

<p>Heads were shaken.</p>

<p>“Never heard him say. He ran away to sea when
he was a kid and never went home again, I reckon.”</p>

<p>“Well,” uttered Charley, “we’ll do the best we
can.”</p>

<p>It was a solemn company which with bared heads
stood about the spot where they laid Sailor Bill. A deep
hole was dug beside the trail, and what was left of
Sailor Bill, wrapped in a blanket, was lowered into it.
Charley read a chapter from the Bible, the hole was
filled, and the wagons made a little detour to drive
across the spot and pack the soil so that the coyotes
would not be tempted to dig there.</p>

<p>“We’ll certainly miss Bill and his ‘Bay of Biscay,
O!’” said the men; and they did.</p>

<p>Henry Renick was appointed by Charley to Sailor
Bill’s wagon and team, and the train rolled on.</p>

<p>Fort Kearney was four days, or fifty miles, ahead.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
On the fourth day a great dust, crossing the Leavenworth
trail, made a cloud against the horizon; and
Charley, pointing, remarked to Davy: “There’s the
Platte trail. We’ll be in Kearney to-night.”</p>

<p>Fort Kearney was located on the south bank of the
Platte River, at the head of a large island thirty miles
long, which was called Grand Island. The military
reservation extended on both sides of the river. The
fort was not nearly so pleasant or so well built as Fort
Leavenworth. The bluffs and the country around
were bare and gray, and the buildings were old frame
buildings, rather tumble-down. The only timber was
on Grand Island, which made a green spot in the landscape.</p>

<p>Fort Kearney was a division point on the Overland
Trail for Russell, Majors &amp; Waddell. Charley
reported to the company agent here, and the train laid
up for a day to rest and restock with what provisions
were needed. The meat was running short, for buffalo
had been scarce all the way from Leavenworth.</p>

<p>At Fort Kearney the Leavenworth trail joined the
main trail that came in from Omaha and Nebraska
City. That trail crossed the Platte just above Fort
Kearney, and there met the Leavenworth trail; and as
one they proceeded west up the south bank of the
Platte.</p>

<p>People at Fort Kearney claimed that on some days
500 wagons passed, headed either west or east. Joel
Badger started in to count the number of teams in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
sight throughout an hour, but quit tired. And truly,
the scene at old Fort Kearney was a stirring one: the
long lines of white-topped wagons slowly toiling in
from the east and the southeast, and, uniting above the
fort, toiling on out, under their dust cloud, up the
river course into the west.</p>

<p>Charley did not delay here longer than was absolutely
necessary, and Davy, as well as others in the
train, was glad to be away on the trail again. Yank,
the assistant wagon boss, and Charley, his chief, almost
had a fight, despite the pledge that they had taken, for
Yank had begun drinking in the groggeries of vicious
Dobytown on the edge of the post and was uglier than
usual.</p>

<p>“You hear what I say,” spoke up Charley loud
enough for everybody else to hear, too. “Any more
of this and you’re discharged without pay. Those are
company orders and you knew it when you signed the
roll.”</p>

<p>“The company that discharges me without pay I’ve
earned will wish it hadn’t,” snarled Yank.</p>

<p>“I’ll take the responsibility,” retorted Charley,
angrily. “If you don’t obey company rules you’re
discharged; see? And if I can’t enforce those rules
I’ll discharge myself.”</p>

<p>Yank said “Bah!” and swaggered off; but he
stayed away from Dobytown.</p>

<p>Fort Kearney seemed to mark a dividing point of
the country as well as of the great trail. The country<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
from Leavenworth up through Kansas had been
prairie-like, with many wooded streams and considerable
green meadows. But here at the Platte the
greenness dwindled, and the trail wound along amidst
sand and clay which grew chiefly sage brush and buffalo
grass.</p>

<p>The Platte was a shallow, shifty stream, full of
quicksands, so that drivers must be very careful in
crossing. Charley told of a time when he saw a whole
freight wagon, load and all, sink and disappear in what
looked to be hard sand under only two inches of
water! The trees in sight were for the most part on
the islands in the river, for all timber within easy reach
along the trail had long ago been cut and burned by the
emigrants. Even buffalo chips were very scarce, so
that Charley took pains to camp on the sites of previous
camps, where cattle had left fuel similar to buffalo
chips, although not so good.</p>

<p>The buffalo chips burned slowly and held the fire
a long time, making splendid coals. The men seemed
to think that this was because they had been lying out
for years, maybe, and were well baked; whereas the
cow chips and the bull chips were newer.</p>

<p>The Platte was frequently bordered by high clay
bluffs; and where the road climbed or descended the
scene at night was very pretty, with all the camp-fires
of the emigrants and other bull trains sparkling high
and low. The bluffs also were good coverts for Indians;
and Charley ordered that each mess have a man<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
on guard all night. Fort Kearney was considered the
jumping-off place for the Indian country and the buffalo
country. Beyond, the country was, as Charley
said, “wide open.”</p>

<p>“To-morrow we’ll cross Plum Creek,” quoth Joel
to Davy on the second day out from Kearney. “We
ought to see buffalo at Plum Creek; ’most always do.”</p>

<p>Plum Creek was 330 miles from Leavenworth and
thirty-six out of Fort Kearney. As they approached
it, Charley and others uttered a glad cry, for buffalo
were in sight by the hundreds. They were grazing on
the hills and flats north of the river. Some emigrants
already were among them, chasing them hither and
thither; so Captain Charley ordered Andy Johnson and
another teamster called “Kentuck” (because he was
from Kentucky) to take Davy’s and Yank’s mules and
go with him after meat.</p>

<p>That was as quickly done as said. Away the
three spurred through the shallow water and on.</p>

<p>“We’ll have short ribs and roast hump to-night,
boys,” shouted back Charley. He and Andy and Kentuck
were good hunters.</p>

<p>This left Yank in charge of the train. He had
not been pleasant since that scene at Kearney, when
he and Charley had the row; just now he was more
irritable and mean, because he had to walk. He
grumbled and snarled, and said a number of unkind
things about Charley which Dave knew were not true.</p>

<p>“Wants to take the huntin’ himself, that feller<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
does,” grumbled Yank, “an’ leaves us other fellers
to hoof it. Who ever heard of an assistant wagon boss
havin’ to walk? I didn’t hire out to walk, you bet.”
And he yelped out to Joel: “Hurry on your bulls
there, you lead team man. Give ’em the gad or you’ll
get stuck.”</p>

<p>For the head of the train had reached a sandy hollow,
and Joel’s team were tugging through it. The
sand rolled in a stream from the tires and from half
way up the spokes; but the twelve bulls—the ten
blacks, and the two burly reds forming the pole yoke—were
pulling together nobly.</p>

<p>“They don’t need it,” returned Joel, shortly.
“They’re doing well. Let ’em alone.”</p>

<p>“You’ve held the lead so long and done as you
please that you’ve got sassy,” sneered Yank. “You
need a new boss, an’ now you’ve got him, see? I tell
you to hustle those fat pets o’ yourn along an’ give
somebody else a chance in here. Do you call that
pullin’? Which way you movin’? Touch ’em up, my
man; touch ’em up.”</p>

<p>“I’m driving this team,” answered Joel, roundly,
“and I don’t need advice from any assistant wagon
master as to <em>how</em> to drive. They pull better without
the lash.” And he sung out vigorously: “Buck!
Muley! Hep, now! Hep with you!”</p>

<p>The wagon moved steadily, ploughing through the
sand and encouraging the teams behind. But Joel’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
reply seemed to enrage Yank—who had been waiting
for just such a chance.</p>

<p>“Oh, gimme that whip!” he snarled, and snatched
it from Joel’s hand. “Get out o’ there with you!” he
yelled. The lash flew hissing; the snapper landed
with a distinct “thut!” on the haunch of the right
lead ox; it jerked smartly back and out-sprang at the
spot where it had struck a rim of blood on the sweaty,
dusty black hide. The whip end had cut through to
the quick!</p>

<p>As fast as lash could travel (and that was fast
indeed) the other lead ox felt like smart and humiliation.
With frenzied, panting snort and groan the
yoke quivered and strained, setting shoulders forward
and fairly jerking the swing yokes after them. It was
an unnecessary strain and Davy knew it.</p>

<p>“Whoa-oa-oa, boys!” soothed Joel. “Easy
now!” And turning like a tiger on Yank, who again
was swinging the whip, he knocked him flat on his
back.</p>

<p>The team went toiling on but Joel stood, panting,
over Yank, and watched him scramble up. Yank’s
hand flew to his revolver butt—and there it stopped;
for when he got that far he was looking into the big
muzzle of Joel’s own Colt’s navy.</p>

<p>“None o’ that either!” growled Joel, boiling mad.
“Gimme that whip,” and he snatched it back again.
“I’ve a notion to lay it on <em>your</em> back. You call yourself
a man and abuse dumb beasts that are doing the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
best they can and doing it well?” He shook his big
fist in Yank’s evil face, which was turning from the
red of anger to the white of fierce hate. “You touch
my team again and I’ll <em>kill</em> you!” roared Joel. “I
told you they were to be let alone and I mean it. Stick
that in your pipe and smoke it.”</p>

<p>Yank said nothing. His eye, where Joel’s fist had
thudded, was swollen shut, but out of the other he
glared steadily; and while he did not move a muscle
(he knew better than to move with that revolver
muzzle trained upon him), if a look could have killed,
then Joel would have dropped in his tracks.</p>

<p>Joel slowly backed away, keeping his Colt’s ready.</p>

<p>“Remember,” he warned. “Don’t try that again.”
And finally, having backed far enough, beyond the
fringe of men who had gathered, he hastened after
his wagon. Davy’s heart could beat again.</p>

<p>“Joel was right in this,” proclaimed a teamster.
“You may be assistant wagon boss but even the boss
himself has no business whipping another man’s bulls.”
And as the men resought their wagons heads wagged
and voices murmured in agreement therewith.</p>

<p>As for Yank, he was growing red again; he cautiously
wiped his injured eye, his hand twitched upon
the butt of his revolver, and picking up his hat he
stumbled forward as if in a dream. The way he acted
was more dangerous, it seemed to Davy, than if he had
stormed and threatened. And Davy was afraid for
Joel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span></p>

<p>The train passed through the sandy hollow without
further mishap; and when they climbed out and pulled
on over the next rise they met the buffalo hunters
returning. The mules’ saddles were red with meat,
and the three riders were well pleased with their hunt.</p>

<p>The sun was low over the trail before, making
golden the dust of travel.</p>

<p>“We’ll camp here, boys,” called Charley, cheerfully,
“and do what butchering we need on those buffalo
carcasses. Swing out, Joel. Whew, man! You must
have had to lay on the lash a bit heavy, didn’t you?”
For the haunches of the lead team were bloody welted.
More than that, the cracker seemed to have taken a
piece of hide out the size of a quarter!</p>

<p>“No,” said Joel, briefly. “I didn’t.”</p>

<p>“Well,” continued Charley, “let’s corral where we
are. Yank, you—what’s the matter with your eye,
man?”</p>

<p>“I fell down,” answered Yank, steadily. And at
the laugh which went up he reddened deeply again,
and again his hand twitched.</p>

<small>DAVY “THE BULL WHACKER”</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Charley scanned him quizzically for a moment.</p>

<p>“You must have fallen mighty hard,” he remarked.
“Who hit you, Yank?”</p>

<p>“That lead teamster o’ yours,” growled Yank, with
a string of oaths. “I’ll get him for that. No man can
strike me and stay long on this earth. The dirty
hound!” And he abused Joel horridly.</p>

<p>Joel heard the loud words, and suddenly leaving his
team where it stood, came walking fast.</p>

<p>“None of that!” he called. “You keep a quiet
tongue in your head. You can see what he did to my
bulls, Charley. He laid my whip on them. I allow
no man to cut my bulls. I never cut them myself.
They were doing as well as they could.”</p>

<p>Charley quickly stepped between the two—for the
hand of each was poised for the dart to revolver butt.</p>

<p>“That’s enough,” he bade. “There’s to be no
fighting in this train and no swearing. You both know
that. Give me your guns. Pass ’em over.”</p>

<p>“All right, Charley,” answered Joel. “Here are
mine if you say so. I don’t need a gun to deal with
that fellow.” And unbuckling his belt he tossed it
aside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span></p>

<p>“Now it’s up to you, Yank,” addressed Charley.</p>

<p>Yank flushed.</p>

<p>“My guns are my own, an’ I’m goin’ to wear ’em
as long as I please,” he blurted.</p>

<p>“No, you aren’t, Yank,” retorted Charley, coolly.
Looking him in the eye, he walked straight to him.
“You needn’t give them to me; I’ll take them. See?”</p>

<p>He was a little man, was Charley, but he had a great
heart and the nerve to back it up. Reaching, while
Yank stood uncertain and cowed, he jerked both revolvers
from the holsters; then he stepped back to put
his foot on Joel’s belt.</p>

<p>“That’s enough,” he said. “I want this matter to
end right here. If you laid whip on another man’s
bulls when there wasn’t any need of it I reckon you got
about what you deserved. We’re not bull skinners in
this train. But I’ll have no fighting in the outfit. You
fellows can settle your differences after you leave. Go
on and finish your corralling, Joel. Yank, you saddle
a fresh mule from the cavvy and ride out and help
Kentuck and Andy butcher those buffalo. Your mule’s
plumb worn out. Hear me?”</p>

<p>Yank glared at him for a moment, but Charley returned
eye for eye. Presently Yank whirled on his
heel, and snatching the bridle of his mule strode off,
muttering, to the cavvy. Joel went back to his team.
Charley shook the cylinders out of the four revolvers,
dropped them into his pockets, and stowed the useless
weapons in one of the wagons. The train proceeded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
about the business of the hour, and Davy, whose heart
had been beating high, helped.</p>

<p>“The ride out yonder will help to cool his blood a
bit,” commented one of the teamsters, referring to
Yank—who, leading Andy and Kentuck, was galloping
furiously away. As for Joel, he was acting as if the
recent trouble was ancient history—except that when
he examined the wounds on his two beloved oxen he
shook his head.</p>

<p>The teams had been unhitched from the wagons
and were being led aside to water and pasture, when a
sudden shout arose.</p>

<p>“Look at Yank! Look at him, will you! Where’s
he going?”</p>

<p>Everybody stared. Leaving Andy and Kentuck
behind, Yank, without slackening pace, was galloping
on and on through the area where the buffalo herd had
been and where the carcasses were lying. Andy and
Kentuck yelled at him, but he paid no heed. And from
the wagon train welled another chorus of cries.</p>

<p>“He’s taking French leave! He’s deserting!”</p>

<p>“Let him go, boys,” quoth Charley, coloring, but
making no move. “I’ll send him his guns sometime;
but he’s forfeited his pay. If he wants to have things
that way, good enough. We’re better off without him.”</p>

<p>The men grunted, satisfied; nobody liked the unruly,
foul-mouthed Yank. Soon he disappeared over
a rise and he was not seen again by Davy for a year.</p>

<p>The camp that evening seemed much pleasanter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
without the presence of Yank. With him absent and
with plenty of buffalo meat on hand, the men laughed
and joked to even an unusual extent. It was a carefree
camp.</p>

<p>“Here are your guns, Joel,” said Charley, returning
them. “Guess I can trust you with them now.
Well, we’re a short train, with two men shy. I’d rather
lose Yank than Sailor Bill; but they’re both gone.
Kentuck, you’re promoted to assistant wagon boss;
and I’ll have to turn your team over to Dave, here.
They’re well broken and I reckon he can drive them.
How about it, Dave?”</p>

<p>Davy was somewhat flustered. He to be a bull
whacker? Hurrah!</p>

<p>“I’ll try,” he stammered.</p>

<p>“Sure you will; and you’ll make good. Fact is,
those bulls drive themselves. But you can learn a heap,
anyway. All right. You take Kentuck’s outfit in the
morning and go ahead. The boys will help you if you
get in trouble. I can’t spare Joel; he’s too good a man
in the lead, and we need him there.”</p>

<p>That night Davy could scarcely go to sleep. He
was excited. He wondered if he really could “make
good” as a bull whacker. He had practised with the
whip and could “throw” it pretty well, although it
was a long lash for a boy. But he had found out that
to wield a bull whip and “pop” it required a certain
knack rather than mere strength; and, besides, the bull
teams behind kept up with the wagons before as a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
matter of habit. Of course, corralling and yoking were
the chief difficulties. But he had watched closely what
the men did every day, and he thought that he <em>knew</em>
how, at least. At any rate, he was bound to try. To
handle twelve oxen seemed to him a bigger job than
being a messenger.</p>

<p>It was a proud Dave who, early in the morning,
after breakfast, at the cry “Catch up, men! Catch
up!” shouldered his yoke and the two bows, and
sturdily trotted for the corral. He knew how to begin.
The proper method was to lay the heavy yoke across
one shoulder with the bows hanging from your arm.
One pin was carried in your mouth, the other in your
hand. The ends of the bows passed up through the
yoke, so that only one end needed a pin thrust through
above the yoke to hold it; the other end stayed of itself.</p>

<p>Davy felt that the men were watching him out of
the corners of their eyes. He heard somebody say,
aside, bantering: “Look out, boys, or that kid will
beat us!” Of course he could not do <em>that</em>! Not yet.
But Charley called to him from the forward gap,
where somebody must stand to keep the cattle in:
“The wheel team first, Dave. You know them, do
you? A pair of big roans.”</p>

<p>Davy nodded. He remembered them; he had
marked them well by a good scrutiny when the herd
was being driven in from pasture.</p>

<p>“All right,” said Charley. “You’ll find them together.
The whole bunch ought to be together.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span></p>

<p>The corral was crowded with oxen and men, and
appeared a mass of confusion; but there was little confusion,
for by this time the oxen and the men all knew
their business. Davy pushed his way straight to the
two big roans (the largest and stoutest bulls always
were chosen for the wheel team, because they must
hold up the heavy pole and also must stand up to the
weight of the wagon down hill), and in approved
fashion laid the yoke across the neck of one.</p>

<p>“Be sure you yoke ’em like they’re used to travellin’,
lad,” warned a kind teamster. “The near and
the off bull, or you’ll have trouble.”</p>

<p>Davy nodded again. He had noted this also. The
“near” bull meant the bull that was yoked to stand
on the left; the “off” bull was the right-hand one.
The near bull of this team had a short horn, he remembered.
He slipped the bow under the near bull’s neck,
and standing on the outside, or left, inserted the ends
of the bow up through the yoke and slipped the pin
in to hold it. Then he hustled around to the opposite
side of the “off” bull, who was standing close to his
mate, shoved him about (“Get ’round there, you!”
ordered Davy, gruffly), and reaching for the yoke
lifted it across, adjusted the bow (from the outside),
slipped in the pin from his mouth—and there he had
his wheel pair yoked together!</p>

<p>Now proud indeed, he led his yoke out through the
other bulls to his wagon. They took position on either
side of the pole, although they seemed a little puzzled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
by the change in manager. Now it only remained to
lift the pole and put the end through the ring riveted
to extend below the middle of the yoke.</p>

<p>“Lead team next,” said Davy, wisely, to himself,
leaving his wheel team and hurrying to shoulder another
yoke and its bows and re-enter the wagon corral.</p>

<p>Every man was supposed to know his twelve bulls
as a father knows his children. Davy’s lead team were
spotted fellows, with long black horns. He went
straight to them where they stood, waiting; yoked them
masterfully and led them, too, out to the wagon. He
put them in position, and with the four other yokes
built his whole team—starting from the rear. The
train was ready and watching, but not impatient. The
men gave him time.</p>

<p>From the middle of each yoke the massive log
chain by which they pulled ran between them back to
the yoke of the pair behind—save that the wheel team
pulled by the tongue and had no chain. Davy worked
hard to hook the chains. A man stepped forward to
help him; but Charley called promptly:</p>

<p>“Let him alone, boys. He’s doing well. He’ll get
the hang of it. Every man to his own team, you
know.”</p>

<p>And Davy was glad.</p>

<p>“All set,” he announced shrilly, for his team were
hooked at last.</p>

<p>“All set,” repeated Charley. “Line out, boys.”</p>

<p>To brisk shout from Joel and crack of his whip the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
lead team straightened their chains and the wagon
moved ahead. One after another the other wagons
followed; and Davy’s team fell into place almost before
he had “popped” his whip and had joined in the cries:</p>

<p>“Haw, Buck! Hep! Hep with you!”</p>

<p>The train retook the trail, Davy trudging like any
other bull whacker on the left side of his wheel yoke,
his whip over his shoulder, his hat shoved back from
his perspiring forehead. He doubted if even Billy
Cody could have done better; and he wished that Billy
might see him.</p>

<p>Ever the trail unfolded on and on, sometimes skirting
the shallow Platte, sometimes diverging a little to
seek easier route. It traversed a country very unattractive,
broken by the clayey buttes and by deep
washes, and running off into wide, sandy plateaus and
bottoms, rife with jack-rabbits, coyotes, prairie-dogs,
antelope, and occasional buffalo. The rattlesnakes
were a great nuisance; the men killed them with the
whip lashes by neatly cutting off their heads as they
coiled or sometimes shot them. And almost every
morning somebody complained of a snake creeping
into his warm blanket.</p>

<p>The processions of emigrants continued as thick
as ever, bound for “Pike’s Peak,” for Salt Lake, California
and Oregon. Each day the stage for Denver
and the stage for Leavenworth passed, dusty and hurrying;
and now was given a glimpse, once in two
weeks, of the Hockaday &amp; Liggett stages, which travelled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
twice a month between St. Joseph, above Leavenworth,
and Salt Lake City. Occasionally Indians—Cheyennes,
Arapahoes, Pawnees and Sioux—came into
the camps begging for “soog” and “cof” and
“tobac.”</p>

<p>Davy enjoyed every mile and he did splendidly.
He enjoyed even the never-varying diet of “sowbelly”
(salt pork), baked beans, hot bread, and sugarless,
milkless coffee, eked out by buffalo meat and antelope
meat when they could get it. Some of the men tried
prairie-dogs—which weren’t so bad as they sound,
tasting and looking like chicken or rabbit. The main
difficulty was to get them after they had been shot,
for they almost always managed to tumble into their
holes. Then, when anybody put a hand in to drag
them out, it was met by the angry whirr of a rattle-snake.
A rattle-snake and a little owl seemed to live
in each hole along with the prairie-dog family!</p>

<p>There were storms, coming up with startling suddenness.
One storm, at Cottonwood Springs a hundred
miles west of Kearney, Davy never forgot. It
was a hail storm. First a mighty cloud of deep purple
shot through with violet lightning, swelled over the
trail in the west. Emigrants scuttled to secure their
wagons, and at Charley’s sharp commands so did the
bull train.</p>

<p>“It looks like a twister, boys,” shouted Charley,
riding back along the train. “Better corral. I’m
afraid for these bulls.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span></p>

<p>So the train corralled in a jiffy; and, unyoked, the
bulls were driven inside. The tongues were hung in
the draw ropes of the wagon covers and the wheels
were chained, wagon to wagon. Slickers were jerked
out from the wagons and donned; and the men prepared
to crawl under the wagon boxes if necessary.</p>

<p>With angry mutter and swollen shape the purple
cloud came on at a tremendous pace. The spin-drift
of it caught the plain far ahead, and one after another
the trains of the emigrants were swallowed in the
blackness. When the first gust struck the bull train
the touch was icy cold.</p>

<p>“Hail, boys! Hail!” shouted Charley. “Watch
the bulls!”</p>

<p>Now sounded a clatter like rain on a sheet-iron
roof; and across the landscape of sand and clay, and a
cottonwood grove at the mouth of the creek, swept a
line of white. The men dived for cover like prairie-dogs
whisking into their holes.</p>

<p>Yes, it was hail! Such hail! Driven by a gale
the stones, some as large as hickorynuts, and all as
large as filberts, lashed the huddled train; whanged
against canvas and wagon-box and with dull thuds
bounded from the bulls’ backs. Some of the animals
shifted uneasily, for the stones stung. The others
stood groaning and grunting with discomfort, shaking
their heads when a particularly vicious missile landed
on an ear. Under the wagons the men were secure;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
but Dave felt sorry for the poor bulls who turned and
sought in vain.</p>

<p>As quickly as it had come the storm passed, leaving
the ground white with the hail. Almost before the
men had crawled out from underneath their wagons
the sun was shining.</p>

<p>The hail had not damaged the bull train to any extent.
There were dents in the tough wood where the
heavy stones had struck, and several of the wagon
sheets, forming the hoods, had been punctured in weak
spots; but thanks to Charley’s promptness in corralling,
the animals had not stampeded. However, some
of the emigrants had not fared so well, because they
had not known what to do. After the bull train was
yoked up again and was travelling on, it passed two
emigrant outfits stalled by the trail, trying to recover
their teams which had run away. Many of the flimsy
cotton hoods used by the emigrants were riddled into
strips.</p>

<p>The Overland Trail followed up the south side of
the Platte, the same way by which Dave had come
down with the Lew Simpson train a year before, after
the fight in the mule fort. Where the North Platte and
the South Platte joined current it continued on up the
South Platte—and now to the north a short distance
was the place where the mule fort had been located so
hastily by Billy Cody and Lew and George Woods.</p>

<p>Soon the main trail for Salt Lake and California
forded the South Platte to cross the narrow point of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
land for Ash Hollow at the North Platte and for
Laramie and Salt Lake City. But the Denver branch
proceeded on into the west by the newer trail to the
mountains and Denver.</p>

<p>This branch of the Overland Trail down to Denver
was only six months old, but already it was a well-worn
trail, scored deep by the stages and by the thousands
of emigrants and the constant freight outfits.
The travel eastward, toward the States, was almost as
great now as that westbound, for fall had come and
everybody who was intending to return to the States
had started so as to get there before winter. A winter
journey by wagon across these plains was no fun.</p>

<p>After the parting of the trail, the next station on
the route was Jules’ Ranch. Jules was an old French-Indian
trapper and trader, whose full name (as he
claimed) was Jules Beni. His mother was a Cheyenne
Indian, and Jules had built a trading post here, a
mile beyond Lodgepole Creek, for trade with the
Cheyennes. Now Jules had turned his attention to
the new business that had opened, and he was selling
flour to the Pike’s Peak “pilgrims” at a dollar a
pound. He had been smart enough to break a new
trail that would bring the travel between the North
and the South Platte past his place—for the regular
crossing was east of him. He was smart, was Old
Jules, and now he had just been made stage agent.</p>

<p>“I want all you fellows to keep clear of Old Jules,”
cautioned Charley, as the train approached what some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
of the men jokingly called “Julesburg.” “I’ve never
seen him when he wasn’t drunk and he’s a corker for
losing his temper and picking fights. Then he wants to
kill somebody. When he’s in liquor he’s plumb crazy.
He’s shot two men and carries their ears in his pocket.
I’m not afraid of him, and neither are you; but to-morrow’s
Sunday and we’ll tie up near his place, and
I don’t want trouble.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you pull right through, Charley?”
asked Andy Johnson, as a spokesman. “We’re agreeable.
‘Dirty Jules’ is no great attraction.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Charley, “we usually do ease off on
Sunday, and it’s company orders and I don’t propose
to change the programme at this stage of the game.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XVIII">XVIII<br />
<small>BILLY CODY TURNS UP AGAIN</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The Russell, Majors &amp; Waddell bull trains were
under instructions to lie by over Sunday whenever
possible. By some people this was accounted a waste
of time. However, Mr. Majors especially insisted that
Sunday should be Sunday wherever it fell, in town or
on the danger trail. One day in seven might well be
spent in rest even with a bull train. It brought the
men and cattle through in better shape, and was a gain
that way instead of any loss.</p>

<p>So that evening the wagon train corralled near
the Platte River crossing, where the Salt Lake Trail
turned north, about half a mile east from Jules’
Ranch. The river was a great convenience, for on
Sunday the men usually tried to slick up by bathing
and washing their clothing and tidying generally.
Therefore, after breakfast the brush near the river
bank was soon displaying shirts and handkerchiefs of
red and blue, and sundry pairs of socks, spread out to
dry, while their owners sat around and fought mosquitoes
and watched the wagon outfits. Some of
these forded the river for Salt Lake, Oregon or California,
but most of them kept on up the Denver
branch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span></p>

<p>This was interrupted by a distant hullabaloo—a
yelling and cheering mingled. The air was thin and
still and very clear, so that sound and eyesight carried
far through it. The hullabaloo evidently came from
Jules’ Ranch, where at the group of buildings a crowd
of people had gathered. Davy’s shirt was dry, and he
reached for it.</p>

<p>“Must be having a celebration over yonder,”
drawled Kentuck. “Reckon I’ll go see.”</p>

<p>He donned his red shirt and started. Several
others made ready to go; and Davy, as curious as anybody,
decided that he would go, too. So, wriggling
into his clothes, whether they were dry or not, he followed
along up the trail to Jules’ place.</p>

<p>The ranch was a small collection of adobe or sun-baked
clay buildings, and a log shack which was the
store. The main excitement was centred in front of
the store. The crowd had formed a circle at a respectful
distance. They were emigrants and a few of the
Charley Martin bull train.</p>

<p>“What’s the row?” queried Kentuck of a man at
his elbow.</p>

<p>“’Pears like this fellow Jules is having a leetle time
with himself,” answered the man. “I ’low he’s crazy.
He’s got whiskey and flour out thar on the ground and
says he’s mixing mortar. It’s a good place for the
whiskey, but it’s an awful waste of flour.”</p>

<p>Edging through the circle, Davy peered to see. A
dirty, darkly sallow visaged, hairy man, in soiled shirt,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
and trousers sagging from their belt, was capering and
screeching, and hoeing at a white mass which might
have been real mortar. But the smell of whiskey was
strong in the air, and there stood a barrel of it with
the head knocked in. The white stuff was flour, for,
as Davy looked, the capering hairy man grabbed a sack,
tore it open and emptied it on the pile.</p>

<p>“I show you how I mek one gr-r-rand mortarr,” he
proclaimed. “Flour at one dollar ze pound, whiskey
at ten dollars ze quart; zat ze way ol’ Jules mek
gr-r-rand mortarr. Wow! Hooray! If anybody
teenk he mek one better mortarr, I cut off hees
ears. Dees my country; I do as I please.” And he
hoed vigorously at his “mortar bed,” and screeched
and capered and threatened and boasted and made a
fool of himself.</p>

<p>Some of the crowd laughed and applauded; but
the majority were disgusted. To Davy it seemed a
great pity that any human being should so lose all control
of himself and be less human than an ape. He
speedily tired of this silly exhibition by Jules, the
store-keeper, and turned away for fresh air. He and
Charley, the wagon boss, emerged from the crowd
together.</p>

<p>“Old Jules is spoiling his own business, I reckon,”
observed Charley. “How any man can watch that in
there and ever taste whiskey again is more than I
know. To see him make a fool of himself is better than
signing a pledge.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span></p>

<p>The crowd rapidly wearied of this drunken Jules
and his antics and dwindled away. As for Davy, he
had decided to take a walk to the mouth of Lodgepole
Creek, up the river a short distance. Lodgepole Creek
emptied in on the opposite side of the Platte, and was
named because the Cheyennes used to gather their
lodge poles along it.</p>

<p>The Platte flowed shallow and wide, with many
sand bars and ripples, and many deepish holes where
the water eddied rapidly. The banks were fringed
with willows not very high. From a rise in the trail
Dave, trudging stanchly in his heavy dusty boots,
beheld an object, far up the channel, beyond the willow
tops, floating down.</p>

<p>It was a large object flat to the water, and as he
peered he saw a flash as from an oar-blade. A boat!
No—too large and low for a boat. It must be a raft
with somebody aboard. Davy waited, inquisitive; for
craft floating on the Platte were a curiosity. The
upper river was too shallow, especially at this time of
the year.</p>

<p>The raft came on gallantly and swiftly. It carried
three persons and their outfit. The crew were standing
up: one of them steering, behind, and one at either
edge, with oars, was helping to fend off from the bars.
It looked like an easy mode of travel, and Davy prepared
to stand out and give the voyagers a cheer.</p>

<p>But just before the raft arrived opposite, going
finely, it appeared to hang on a snag or else strike a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
sudden eddy; or perhaps it did both at once; nobody
could tell. Under Davy’s astonished eyes it stopped
for a moment in mid-stream; the crew wildly dug with
their oars and fell to their hands and knees; whirling
around and around the platform fairly melted away
underneath them, leaving only three black dots on the
surface of the water. These were heads!</p>

<p>Waking to the situation, Davy waved and shouted;
the swimmers may have seen him, he thought, because
they were making for his side. The current bore them
along, as sometimes they swam and sometimes they
waded; and he kept pace to encourage. As the foremost
neared the bank, Davy rushed down and waded
in to meet him and help him ashore. He wasn’t a very
large person—that drenched figure floundering and
splashing for safety; he wasn’t large at all; and extending
a hand, to give him a boost, Davy gasped, only
half believing:</p>

<p>“<a href="#i_fp260">Why—hello, Billy!</a> Gee whiz! <a href="#i_fp260">Is that you?</a>”</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_fp260">
  <img src="images/i_fp260.jpg"  alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><a href="#Page_261">“WHY—HELLO, BILLY! IS THAT YOU?”</a></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>“Hello, Dave,” answered Billy Cody, muddy and
dripping, but calmly shaking Dave’s hand. “I guess it
must be. Where are Hi and Jim?” And he turned
quickly to scan the river. “Good. They’re coming.
I knew they could swim. They can swim better than
I, so I reckoned I’d get ashore as soon as I could.
What are you doing here and where are you bound
for?”</p>

<p>“I’m bull whacking for Russell, Majors &amp; Waddell<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
from Leavenworth to Denver,” informed Davy,
proudly. “Where are you bound for?”</p>

<p>“Back to the river.” And by “the river” Davy
knew that Billy meant the Missouri. “We didn’t have
any luck in the diggin’s, so we thought we’d float home
down the Platte to the Missouri and down the Missouri
to Leavenworth. Well, we got this far, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Jiminy crickets!” shouted Hi, now plashing in.
“If here isn’t Dave waiting for us! Did you come all
the way from Leavenworth to meet us, Dave?”</p>

<p>And there was a great shaking of hands.</p>

<p>“I dunno what the dickens happened to us out
there,” volunteered Jim, gazing at the river suspiciously.
“One moment we were just sailing along and
next moment we were swimming. No more sailoring
for me; I’d rather walk with a bull team. Here we’ve
lost our whole outfit and we’re going home from the
diggin’s ‘busted’ flat.”</p>

<p>“We didn’t have much to lose; that’s one comfort,”
said Billy. “Think how bad we’d be feeling if
we’d struck it rich up in the mountains and every ounce
was now at the bottom of the Platte! Huh! We’ve
had our fun, anyhow. Who’s your wagon boss,
Dave?”</p>

<p>“Charley Martin.”</p>

<p>“Where are you camped?”</p>

<p>“At the Platte crossing, just below Jules’.”</p>

<p>“All right,” quoth Billy, cheerily. “Come on, boys.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
I’m going down to the camp and see what I can get,
and Charley’ll grub-stake us home.”</p>

<p>They had clambered up the bank into the dryness,
and now they continued down the trail—Billy and Hi
and Jim clumping and squashing, Davy tramping sturdily
in his teamster costume of flannel shirt and trousers
tucked into big boots.</p>

<p>“So you’re a sure-’nough bull whacker, are you?”
asked Hi of Davy, with a grin.</p>

<p>“I was hired just as an ‘extra’ for carrying messages,
you know,” said Davy, to be both honest and
modest. “But we ran short of men so Charley put me
at whacking. I can sling a whip some; that is, pretty
good. The bulls are trained, anyway.”</p>

<p>“When did you begin?” asked Billy.</p>

<p>“Back at Plum Creek.”</p>

<p>“If you’ve held your job this far, then, I guess you
can hold it as long as you like. Bully for you, Red.”
And at Billy’s generous praise Davy blushed.</p>

<p>The excitement at Jules’ trading store had quieted
and only the mess of whiskey-sodden flour remained.
Billy and Jim paid scant attention to this, except that
they, too, were disgusted when they heard what old
Jules had been up to. They were more intent upon
getting to the wagon train camp. And here Charley
Martin and the whole outfit, in fact, received them with
a great ado. Everybody in the train seemed to know
Billy, and almost everybody knew Hi and Jim.</p>

<p>There was a stranger to Davy in camp. He had
arrived in a light buggy drawn by a strong, spirited
team of black horses, and was chatting with Charley.
His name proved to be B. F. Ficklin—“Ben” Ficklin.
He shook hands with Billy, and Billy introduced Dave.</p>

<p>“Mr. Ficklin, this is my friend Dave Scott,
youngest bull whacker on the plains.”</p>

<p>“You want to watch out or he’ll catch up with you,
Billy,” bantered Mr. Ficklin.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t wonder,” answered Billy, carelessly.
“But I’ve got a head start over him. I’m a prairie
sailor sure now, and navigation on the Platte is
closed!”</p>

<p>Not only in sailing on the Platte, but in many other
feats Dave never did catch up with Billy Cody.</p>

<p>Mr. Ficklin was the general superintendent of the
Russell, Majors &amp; Waddell freighting and staging business.
He bore the news that the company had taken
over the stage outfit of Hockaday &amp; Liggett, which
ran twice a month from St. Joseph on the Missouri to
Salt Lake on the Platte River Overland Route, and
were going to combine the Leavenworth &amp; Pike’s Peak
Express with it. He himself was on his way from
Denver, back down the trail to inspect the condition
of the stations from the Platte crossing to the Missouri.</p>

<p>“We’re going to make this stage line a hummer,
boys,” he informed. “Hockaday &amp; Liggett have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
running two times a month on a schedule of twenty-one
days to Salt Lake; no stations, and same team without
change for several hundreds of miles at a stretch.
The company are putting in stations every ten and
fifteen miles all along the Overland route from the
river to Salt Lake, and stocking them with provisions
and fodder. We’re buying the best Kentucky mules that
we can find and ordering more Concord coaches; and
we’re going to put a coach through every day in the
year, from the Missouri to Salt Lake, on a ten-day
schedule, by the Salt Lake Overland Trail to the crossing
here, then north to Laramie and over the South
Pass. A stage will be sent down to Denver, too.”</p>

<p>Mr. Ficklin evidently was an enthusiast. Davy had
heard of him—a hard worker and a booster for the
company that he loved.</p>

<p>“What’s ever become of the scheme of yours and
that California senator, Gwin, to put a fast mail service
through, horseback, from St. Louis to San Francisco,
by the Overland route, at $500 for each round trip,”
asked Joel of Mr. Ficklin.</p>

<p>“Nothing yet. Senator Gwin was right for it after
our talk on the stage from California five years ago,
and he introduced a bill in Congress; but the bill died.
The California people are howling, though, for something
better than news three weeks to six weeks old
from the East. And mark my words,” continued Mr.
Ficklin, earnestly, “that’s what will happen next—a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
pony express from the Missouri to the coast that will
beat the stage.”</p>

<p>“Do you think they’ll stretch a line of relays clear
across for two thousand miles and keep it going day
and night passing the mail along?” demanded Billy,
his eyes sparkling at the fancy.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” answered Mr. Ficklin, shortly.</p>

<p>“Well, when they do I want to ride one of the
runs—one that will keep me hopping, too,” declared
Billy.</p>

<small>DAVY MAKES ANOTHER CHANGE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Did you see my mother when you were back East,
Dave?” asked Billy.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“How’s she looking?”</p>

<p>“Not extra good, Billy. She’s not very well, and
she said if I came across you to tell you she’d like to
see you as soon as she could.”</p>

<p>“How are the girls?”</p>

<p>“They’re all right.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry about ma,” mused Billy, soberly. “If
she’s poorly I’m going home as straight as I can
travel, you can bet on that.”</p>

<p>“We can give you a job with the bull train, Billy,”
proffered Charley Martin. “We’re short of men.”</p>

<p>But Billy shook his head.</p>

<p>“No, sir. I’m due at the Cody place in Salt Creek
Valley.”</p>

<p>“Well, Billy, in that case I’ll pass you through on
the next stage, if there’s room,” volunteered Mr.
Ficklin.</p>

<p>“I can hang on somewhere,” asserted Billy. “The
pass is the main thing. Never mind the room.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span></p>

<p>While they all were talking a new arrival halted
near. It was an army ambulance—a wagon with black
leather top, seats running around the inside, and four
big black army mules as the team. It was bound west.
A soldier in dusty blue uniform was the driver, and a
corporal of infantry sat beside him, between his knees
a Sharp’s carbine. From the rear of the ambulance
another soldier briskly piled out. By his shoulder
straps and the white stripes down his trouser-seams he
was an officer; by the double bars on his shoulder
straps a captain. He wore a revolver in holster.</p>

<p>He walked over to the group and nodded.</p>

<p>“Hello, Ben.”</p>

<p>“How are you, captain.” And Mr. Ficklin arose
to shake hands.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” continued Mr. Ficklin, “I want to
introduce Captain Brown.”</p>

<p>“I believe I know the captain,” spoke Charley, also
shaking hands.</p>

<p>“Hello, Billy,” addressed the captain, catching
sight of him. “What’s the matter? Been swimming?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” laughed Billy. “The water’s a little cold
up in the mountains, so I took my annual down here.”</p>

<p>“Billy’s been at the diggin’s, captain,” vouchsafed
Mr. Ficklin. “He brought down so much gold in his
hide that he couldn’t travel till he’d washed it out.”</p>

<p>Billy took their joking good-naturedly. That he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
was going home “broke” had not discouraged him at
all.</p>

<p>“I know one thing, gentlemen,” he declared. “I’m
not a miner, but I had to learn. The plains for me after
this. You’ll find me bobbing up again.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you can’t keep Billy Cody down, that’s a
fact,” agreed Mr. Ficklin. “Where are you bound,
captain? Denver?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. Laramie. I’ve just come through from
Omaha. I hear you fellows are putting on a daily
stage to Salt Lake to connect there with the line for
San Francisco.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. It’ll be running this month, and it’ll
be a hummer. I’m on my way to inspect the stations
now.”</p>

<p>“This is my friend Dave Scott, captain,” introduced
Billy, in his generous way. “He’s the youngest
bull whacker on the trail.”</p>

<p>“He must be a pretty close second to you, then,
Billy,” remarked Captain Brown, extending his hand
to Davy, who, as usual, felt embarrassed. “You
started in rather young yourself!” The captain (who
was a tanned, stoutly-built man, with short russet beard
and keen hazel eyes) scanned Davy sharply. He
scratched his head. “I don’t see why I can’t get hold
of a boy like you or Billy,” he said. “I prefer red-headed
boys. I was red-headed myself once, before
the Indians scared my hair off.”</p>

<p>“You’re a bit red-headed now, captain,” slyly asserted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
Charley; for the captain’s bald pate certainly
was well burned by the sun.</p>

<p>“Well, I <em>feel</em> red-headed, too,” retorted the captain.
“So would you if every time you got a clerk he
deserted to the gold fields. Lend me this boy, will you,
Martin? He’s in your train, isn’t he? I’ll take him on
up to Laramie with me and give him a good job in the
quartermaster’s department. There’s a place there
for somebody just about his size, boots and all.” And
the captain, who evidently had taken a fancy to the
sturdy Dave, smiled at him.</p>

<p>All of a sudden Davy wanted to go. He had heard
of Fort Laramie, that important headquarters post on
the North Platte in western Nebraska (which is to-day
Wyoming) near the mountains, and he wanted to see
it. Billy had been there several times with the bull
trains out of Leavenworth, and had told him about it.</p>

<p>“I’d like to oblige you, captain,” answered Charley.
“But we’re short handed this trip, and Davy’s a valuable
man. He’s making quite a bull whacker. Besides,
I reckon he’s counting on going to school this
winter in Leavenworth; aren’t you, Davy?”</p>

<p>Davy nodded.</p>

<p>“I thought I’d better,” he said. “That’s one
reason I left Denver.”</p>

<p>“He can go to school at Laramie,” asserted the
captain quickly. “We have a school for the post children
there, and it’s a good one.”</p>

<p>Davy listened eagerly, and it was plain to be seen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
how <em>he</em> was inclined. Denver meant only a short stay,
for Charley was anxious to start back again before
winter closed in on the plains, and there might not be
any chance to see Mr. Baxter, after all. Laramie
sounded good.</p>

<p>“Oh, shucks!” blurted Jim. “If you want to let
Dave out, Charley, I’d as lief go on to Denver and
finish with you.”</p>

<p>“So would I,” added Hi.</p>

<p>“How about it, Dave?” queried Charley. “Is it
Denver or Leavenworth, or Laramie, for you?”</p>

<p>“I’d like to try Laramie first-rate but I don’t want
to quit the train unless you say so,” answered Dave,
honestly. “I hired out for the trip, and Mr. Russell
and Mr. Majors expect me to go through.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Majors knows me and so does Billy Russell,”
put in the captain. “I’ll write Majors a letter
and give him a receipt for one red-headed boy, with
guarantee of good treatment. I tell you, Martin, the
United States has need for one red-headed boy, name
of Dave, in the quartermaster service at Fort Laramie;
and I believe I’ll have to send a detail out on the trail
and seize him by force of arms.” The captain, of
course, was joking, but he also seemed in earnest. “If
he’s employed by Russell, Majors &amp; Waddell that’s
recommendation enough, and I want him all the more.”</p>

<p>Charley laughed.</p>

<p>“Oh, in that case, and if he wants to go, I suppose
I’ll have to let him, and take Jim and Hi on in his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
place. They two ought to be able to fill his job. If
you say so, Dave, I’ll give you your discharge right
away, and a voucher for your pay to date, and you
can see how you like the army for a change.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead, Red,” bade Billy. “You’ll learn a heap,
and I’ll be out that way myself soon. First thing you
know you’ll see me coming through driving stage or
riding that pony express. Whoop-la!”</p>

<p>And of this Davy did not have the slightest doubt.</p>

<p>Captain Brown declined an invitation to stay for
dinner with the mess. He was in a hurry. So the
exchange of Davy from bull whacking to Government
service was quickly made. Before he was an hour
older he had shaken hands with everybody within
reach and was trundling northward in the black covered
ambulance beside Captain Brown. He knew that
in another hour or two Billy himself would be travelling
east, back to Salt Creek Valley and Leavenworth;
and that early in the morning the bull train, with
Charley and Joel and Kentuck and Hi and Jim and
all, would be travelling west for the end of the trail
at Denver.</p>

<p>This was just like the busy West in those days;
friends were constantly mingling and parting, each on
active business—to meet again a little later and report
what they had been doing in the progress of the big
country.</p>

<p>“You’re too young to follow bull whacking, my
boy,” declared the captain. “It’s a rough life and a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
hard one. To earn your own way and know how to
hold up your end and take care of yourself is all very
well; but you’d better mix in with it the education of
books and cultured people as much as you can while
you go along. Then you’ll grow up an all-round man
instead of a one-sided man. Laramie’s a long way
from the States; but we’ve got a small post school and
a few books, and it’s the home of a lot of cultured men
and women. You’ll learn things there that you’ll never
learn roughing it on the trail.”</p>

<p>And Davy looked forward to life at old Fort Laramie,
the famous army post and freight and emigrant
station on the Overland Trail to Salt Lake, Oregon and
California.</p>

<p>The fording of the Platte was made in quick time
to foil the quicksands. The North Platte was now
scarce eighteen miles across the narrow tongue of land
separating the two rivers above their juncture. It was
struck at Ash Hollow. Ash Hollow had a grocery store
for emigrant trade. The sign read “BUTTE,
REGGS, FLOWER and MELE.”</p>

<p>Captain Brown halted here long enough to buy a
few crackers and some sardines.</p>

<p>“Thought we’d stock up while we can,” he explained
to Dave. “These and what buffalo meat we
have will carry us quite a way. Laramie’s one hundred
and sixty miles, and I’m going to push right
through.”</p>

<p>The four stout mules ambled briskly at a good eight<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
miles an hour, following the trail into the west, up the
south bank of the river. The trail was broad and
plain, but it was not so crowded with emigrants as it
had been before the Pike’s Peak portion of it had
branched off. However, there still were emigrants;
and there were many bull trains bound out for Laramie
and Fort Bridger and Salt Lake, for this was the main
Overland Trail, dating back fifty years.</p>

<p>The ambulance rolled on without slackening, except
for sand or short rises, until after sunset. Then
the captain gave the word to stop. By this time he
knew Dave’s history, and Davy was liking him immensely.
They clambered stiffly out. The driver and
corporal unhitched the mules: and while the corporal
made a fire for coffee, the driver (who was a private)
put the mules out to graze.</p>

<p>“We’ll take four hours, Mike,” said the captain
to the corporal. “Then we’ll make another spurt until
daylight.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” answered the corporal, saluting.</p>

<p>“You’d do well to crawl in the wagon and sleep,
after supper, Dave,” advised the captain to Davy.
“We’ll be travelling the rest of the night. Can you
stand it?”</p>

<p>Davy laughed. A great question, that, to ask of a
boy who’d just been a bull whacker walking across the
plains!</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Davy took a nap in the bottom of the
ambulance; and more than a nap. When he awakened,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
he had been aroused by the jolting of his bed. A buffalo
robe had been thrown over him, the captain was
sitting in a corner snugly wrapped, and by the light
of a half moon the ambulance was again upon its way.</p>

<p>In the morning, when they once more halted to rest
and feed the mules, the country was considerably
rougher, with hills and fantastic rocks breaking the
sagy, gravelly landscape. The white-topped wagons
of emigrants and the smoke of their camp-fires were
in sight, before and behind; and not far ahead a bull
outfit were driving their bulls into the wagon corral
to yoke up for the day’s trail.</p>

<p>Breakfast was coffee and buffalo meat; but Corporal
Mike mounted one of the mules and rode off the
trail. When he returned he had some sage chickens
and an antelope. The sides of the ambulance had been
rolled up; and about noon, pointing ahead the captain
remarked to Davy:</p>

<p>“That’s Laramie Peak, beyond the post. We’ve
got only about eighty miles to go and we’ll be in bright
and early.”</p>

<p>The landmark of Laramie Peak, of the Black Hills
Range of the Rocky Mountains, remained in sight all
day, slowly standing higher. The sun set behind it.
Davy snoozed in the bottom of the ambulance. The
captain had spoken truth, for shortly after sunrise
they sighted the flag streaming over Fort Laramie.</p>

<p>Old Fort Laramie was not so large a post as Fort<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
Leavenworth; it was not so large as Fort Kearney,
even. Davy was a little disappointed, for “Laramie”
was a name in the mouth of almost every bull whacker
in the Russell, Majors &amp; Waddell trains out of Leavenworth,
and the men were constantly going “out to
Laramie” and back. The post stood on a bare plateau
beside Laramie Creek about a mile up from the Platte;
some of the buildings were white-washed adobe, some
were logs, and some were of rough-sawed lumber.
Back of the fort were hills, and beyond the hills, to the
southwest, were mountains—Laramie Peak being the
sentinel.</p>

<p>It was the important division point on the Overland
Trail to Salt Lake; maintained here in the Sioux
Indian country to protect the trail and to be a distributing
point for Government supplies. It was garrisoned
by both cavalry and infantry; on the outskirts
were cabins of Indian traders and trappers and other
hangers-on, and there were a couple of stores that
sold things to emigrants. Sioux Indians usually were
camping nearby, in time of peace.</p>

<p>Davy changed his rough teamster costume for
clothes a little more suited to a clerk and messenger in
the quartermaster’s department, and was put to work
by Captain Brown, the acting quartermaster. The
post proved a busy place, with the quartermaster’s
offices the busiest of all; but the captain and Mrs.
Brown saw that Dave was courteously treated and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
given a fair show. He went to evening school, and
had books to read; and once in a while was allowed
time for a hunt. In fact, Fort Laramie, away out here,
alone, guarding the middle of the Overland Trail
through to Salt Lake, was by no means a stupid or
quiet place.</p>

<p>Of course, the trail was what kept it lively, for
every day news from the States and from the farther
west arrived with the emigrants and the bull trains;
and scarcely had Dave been settled into his new niche,
when arrived the first of the new daily stages from
the Missouri. It was preceded by a slender, gentlemanly
man named Bob Scott, dropped off by one of
the company wagons which was establishing the
stations. Bob Scott was to drive stage from Fort Laramie
on to Horseshoe, thirty-six miles, and he was here
in readiness. He seemed to be well known on the trail,
for many persons at the post called him “Bob.”</p>

<p>“When do you expect to start on the run, Bob?”
asked the captain.</p>

<p>“I think about next Tuesday, captain,” answered
Bob, in his quiet, easy tone. “The first coach leaves
to-day, I understand, from St. Joe.”</p>

<p>“They’ll make it through in six days, will they?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. Ten days to Salt Lake is the schedule—an
average of one hundred and twenty miles a day.
At Salt Lake the express and passengers are transferred
to the George Chorpening line to Placerville,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
California, and from Placerville they’re sent on to
Sacramento and San Francisco. I understand the
time from the Missouri River to San Francisco will
be about eighteen days.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t heard what’s to be the name of the
new company, have you, Bob?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. ‘Central Overland, California &amp;
Pike’s Peak Express’ is to be the name; the ‘C. O. C.
&amp; P. P.’”</p>

<p>Stables and express station and a relay of horses
had been established adjacent to the post. The old
stage company, Hockaday &amp; Liggett, had worked on a
loose, go-as-you-please system which was very different
from the way that Russell, Majors &amp; Waddell
went at it. Now, with things in readiness along the
line, clear to Salt Lake City, Tuesday dawned on a
post eagerly hoping that Bob Scott’s calculation would
prove true.</p>

<p>About eleven o’clock a murmur and hustle in the
post announced that the stage was in sight. It came
with a rush and a cheer—its four mules at a gallop,
up the trail, the big coach swaying behind them, the
driver firm on his box. Stain of dust and mud and
rain and snow coated the fresh coach body, for all the
way from the Missouri River, 600 miles, had it come,
through all kinds of weather, and had been travelling
night and day for six days. At top and bottom of
the frame around the stiffened canvas ran the legend:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
“Central Overland California &amp; Pike’s Peak Express
Co.”</p>

<p>“Wild Bill” Hickok himself it was who, coolly
tossing his lines to the hostler, waiting to take them
and lead the horses to the stable, drawing off his gloves
bade, for the benefit of his passengers:</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, you have forty minutes here for
dinner.”</p>

<p>At the same moment the station keeper’s wife began
to beat a sheet-iron gong as dinner signal.</p>

<small>FAST TIME TO CALIFORNIA</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Dave was heartily glad to see Wild Bill again—and
Wild Bill seemed glad to see Davy.</p>

<p>“I heard you were out in this region,” said Wild
Bill, after they had shaken hands. “Billy Cody told
me.”</p>

<p>“When did you see him, Bill?”</p>

<p>“Last time was when I was out to his house about
a month ago. He was planning on a trapping and
hunting trip with a man named Harrington up in the
Republican country north of Junction City. But he’ll
be on the trail again in the spring; you mark my
word.”</p>

<p>“So you’re driving stage, are you, Bill?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I’m running between Horse Creek and
Laramie, forty-two miles. It’s a great outfit, the C.
O. C. &amp; P. P.—the finest coaches and mules I’ve ever
seen, and plenty of stations and feed. Now it’s up to
the drivers to make the schedule.” And Wild Bill
sauntered off, nodding to acquaintances, to wash and
eat.</p>

<p>Davy joined the group admiring the coach. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
evidently had been prepared especially for the occasion
of the first trip through. It was a new “Concord,”
built by the famous stage-coach manufacturers, the
Abbot-Downing Company, of Concord, New Hampshire.
The large round, deep body was enclosed at the
sides by canvas curtains that could be rolled up; and
behind, it was extended to form a large roomy triangular
pocket, or “boot,” for mail and baggage.
The driver’s seat, in front, was almost on the level
with the roof; and beneath it was another pocket, or
boot, for express and other valuables. A pair of big
oil lamps sat upon brackets, at either end of the
driver’s seat. The coach body was slung upon heavy
straps forming the “throughbrace,” instead of resting
upon springs; and here it securely cradled. It had
been painted red and decorated with gilt.</p>

<p>This coach had space for six passengers, three in
a seat facing three others in an opposite seat. The
coach was filled, when it had arrived, with the six
passengers and a lot of mail; Wild Bill on the box,
and beside him a wiry little man, who was Captain
Cricket, the express messenger.</p>

<p>Bob Scott and Wild Bill ate dinner together at the
station. The fresh team of mules had been harnessed
into the traces, and were being held by the heads.
Bob looked at his watch, drew on his gloves, circuited
the mules with an eye to their straps and buckles, laid
his overcoat (a fine buffalo coat with high beaver<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
collar) on his seat, and grasping lines and whip climbed
up. Captain Cricket nimbly followed.</p>

<p>“All ready, gentlemen,” announced Bob, his foot
on the brake, poised to release it. The passengers came
hurrying out and into the coach. Bob gave one glance
over his shoulder. Then—“Let ’er go,” he bade the
hostlers.</p>

<p>“Whang!” his brake released; the hostlers leaped
aside; out flew his lash, forward sprang the mules, and
away went coach and all, in a flurry of dust, for the
next run, to Horseshoe Creek, thirty-six miles. Run
by run, up the Sweetwater River, over South Pass,
down to the Sandy and the Green Rivers, through
Fort Bridger and Echo Canyon, one hundred and more
miles every day, would it speed, by relays of teams and
of drivers, until the last team and last driver would
bring it into Salt Lake.</p>

<p>Wild Bill took a horse and returned to his east
station, to drive in the next westbound stage. Every
day a stage came through, and presently the stages
from the west began coming back. The driver who
brought in a stage from one direction took back the
stage going in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>The stages through to Salt Lake and to the Missouri
brought considerable new life to Fort Laramie.
Papers and letters from New York and San Francisco
arrived so quickly after being mailed that it was easy
to see what a great treat this service was to Salt Lake<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
and Denver and every little settlement along the whole
route.</p>

<p>Mr. Ficklin was general superintendent of the line,
and was constantly riding up and down. No person
who passed by was better liked than Superintendent
Ficklin. Mr. Russell was in Washington, but Mr.
Majors appeared, once, stepping from the stage; and
he had not forgotten Davy.</p>

<p>“Your pardner, Billy Cody, almost met his end
this winter, my lad,” he informed. “Did you hear
about it?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” gasped Dave.</p>

<p>“Well, he did. He was up in central Kansas on a
trapping trip, and lost his oxen and broke his leg and
had to be left alone in a dug-out while his companion
went one hundred and twenty-five miles, afoot, to the
nearest settlement for a team and supplies. Billy got
snowed in, couldn’t move anyway, a gang of Indians
plundered him and might have murdered him, and
when, on the twenty-ninth day—nine days late—his
friend finally arrived and yelled to him, Billy could
scarcely answer. Even then the snow had to be dug
away from the door. But he reached home safely and
he’s getting along finely now. He’s plucky, is Billy—and
so was his friend, Harrington.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he won’t want to go out on the plains any
more,” faltered Dave.</p>

<p>“Who? Billy Cody?” And Mr. Majors laughed.
“You wait till the grass begins to get green and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
willow buds swell, and you’ll see Billy Cody right on
deck, ready for business.”</p>

<p>Back and forth, between Salt Lake and the Missouri
River shuttled the stages of the Central Overland,
California &amp; Pike’s Peak Express. They seemed
to be making money for the company, but rumors
said that the company needed more money; in fact,
the company were in a bad way. The expenses had
been tremendous. The big coaches cost $1000 apiece—and
there were fifty of them. The harness for each
four-mule team was made in Concord, and it cost
about $150. Then there were 10,000 tons of hay a
year, at twenty to thirty dollars a ton; and 3,000,000
pounds of corn and another 3,000,000 pounds of grain,
at several cents a pound; and 2000 mules at seventy-five
dollars each; and the wages of the men—$100 a
month and board for the division agents, $50 and $75
a month for the drivers, $50 a month for the station
agents, and $40 a month for the hostlers who took care
of the mules.</p>

<p>But even under this expense it seemed as though the
passenger fare of $125 to Denver and $200 to Salt
Lake (meals extra at a dollar and a dollar and a half),
and the heavy rates on express ought to bring the
company a profit. Davy, trying to figure out the
matter, hoped so. Of course, it was not his business,
but a fellow likes to have his friends successful; and
Dave looked upon Mr. Majors, and Mr. Russell, and
Mr. Waddell as very good friends of his.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span></p>

<p>He took a trip, once in a while, on the stage east
with Wild Bill, or west with “Gentleman Bob,” on
quartermaster’s affairs, to some of the stations. There
always was room on the driver’s box, and generally
Wild Bill or “Gentleman Bob” was glad to have him
up there along with the messenger.</p>

<p>“Gentleman Bob” proved to be as remarkable a
character as Wild Bill Hickok. When approaching
stations Wild Bill signalled with a tremendous piercing:
“Ah-whoop-pee!” and arrived on the run.
Gentleman Bob whistled shrilly. The teams for
either of them had to be changed in less than four
minutes, or there was trouble. The Overland stage
waited for naught.</p>

<p>Wild Bill passed the news on to Gentleman Bob,
and Gentleman Bob it was who passed it to Davy, as
one fresh, windy morning in this the spring of 1860,
Dave gladly clambered up to the driver’s box to ride
through to the end of the run at Horseshoe.</p>

<p>“Let ’er go!” yelped Bob, kicking the brake free;
and to mighty lunge and smart crack of lash the coach
jumped forward, whirling away from the station for
another westward spurt.</p>

<p class="noi">warbled Gentleman Bob, flicking the off lead mule
with the whip cracker. No bull whacker in any Russell,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
Majors &amp; Waddell outfit could sling a whip
more deftly than “Gentleman Bob,” a “king of the
road.” “Do you know what that means, nowadays,
Red—‘C. O. C. &amp; P. P.’?”</p>

<p>“What, Bob?”</p>

<p>“Clean Out of Cash &amp; Poor Pay!”</p>

<p>“Aw!” scoffed Davy. “Is it as bad as that?”</p>

<p>“Pretty near,” asserted Bob. But that wasn’t his
news. His news followed. “Do you know something
else; what’s going to happen next on this blooming
road?”</p>

<p>“Pony express!” hazarded Dave.</p>

<p>Bob turned his head and coolly stared.</p>

<p>“How’d you find out?”</p>

<p>“I guessed. Mr. Ficklin spoke about it a long
time ago.”</p>

<p>“Well, she’s due, and Ben Ficklin and Billy Russell
and Alex Majors and that crowd are back of it.
You saw Billy Russell go through Laramie last month.
He’s been buying hosses—the best in the country, two
hundred of ’em, at from one hundred to two hundred
dollars apiece. Read this advertisement in the paper;
that’ll tell you the scheme.” And reaching in behind
the leather apron which covered the front of the
pocket or “boot” under his seat, Bob extracted a
newspaper. He indicated with his thumb. “Read
that,” he bade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span></p>

<p>It was a “Missouri Republican,” date of March
26. The article said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noic">TO SAN FRANCISCO IN EIGHT DAYS<br />

<p>The first courier of the Pony Express

on Tuesday, April 3, at 5 o’clock p. m.,
and will run regularly weekly thereafter,
carrying a letter mail only.

announced later.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The letter mail will be delivered

<p>There was more than this to the advertisement,
but these were the paragraphs that appealed to Davy.</p>

<p>“Pretty slick they’ve all been about it, too,” resumed
Bob, tucking the paper away again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span></p>

<p>“You’re right,” spoke the express messenger—who
was Captain Cricket, again on his way through to
Salt Lake. “They’ve bought the ponies and hired
the riders, sixty of them. The route’s being divided
into runs of seventy-five or a hundred miles, and
stocked with horses, every ten or fifteen miles, for
change of mounts.”</p>

<p>“Do you think it’ll pay?” asked Gentleman Bob.</p>

<p>“Pay? No! It can’t pay. But it’ll be a big advertisement
for this company. They count on showing
the Government that the Salt Lake Trail can be
travelled quicker and easier than the old Butterfield
overland trail through Texas, and on taking the mail
and express business away from it.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to ride one of those runs,” asserted Dave,
boldly.</p>

<p>Gentleman Bob laughed and cracked his silk lashed
whip, of which he was very proud.</p>

<p>“I expect you would, Red,” he agreed. “But this
riding a hundred miles or more at a gallop without rest
is no kid’s job, you’d find.”</p>

<p>“Billy Cody’ll ride, though, I bet a dollar,” returned
Davy.</p>

<p>Gentleman Bob scratched his cheek with his whip
stock, and deliberated.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, “I shouldn’t wonder if he would.”</p>

<p>Events moved rapidly now after the Pony Express
had been announced. Three new horses were stabled
at the stage station; two were wiry ponies, the other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
was a mettlesome horse of such extra good points that
Gentleman Bob pronounced him a Kentucky thoroughbred.
The station force of men were increased by
Pony Express employees, and a rider himself arrived
who had been engaged to take the run from Laramie
west to the next “home” station, Red Buttes, ninety-eight
miles. His name was “Irish Tom,” and he did
not weigh more than one hundred pounds; but every
pound of him seemed to be good hard muscle.</p>

<p>Irish Tom had come in from the west. He said
that he had been one of sixty riders hired at Carson
City, Nevada, by Bolivar Roberts, who was the superintendent
of the Western Division of the Pony
Express. According to Irish Tom every man had to
prove up that he was experienced on the plains and in
the mountains, and could ride. Altogether, there were
eighty riders waiting, stationed all the way across the
continent from St. Joseph on the Missouri to Sacramento
in California; there were over 400 picked horses,
which would gallop at top speed up hill and down,
through sand and mud, snow and water and sun, for at
least ten miles at a stretch.</p>

<p>The start from both ends of the route, from St.
Joseph and from Sacramento, was to be made (as
advertised) on April 3. Of course there was no way
of knowing at Laramie, for instance, whether the
start had been made; the Pony Express would bring
its own news, for the railroad and the telegraph were
the only things that could beat it, and these seemed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
a long way in the future. As for the Overland Stage,
the Pony Express was scheduled to travel two miles
to the stage’s one!</p>

<p>April 3rd passed; so did April 4th and 5th. It was
figured at the post and stage station that on a schedule
of ten miles an hour, including stops, the 600 miles to
Laramie would bring the first rider through early on
April 6th. The west-bound rider would reach Laramie
before the east-bound rider, because the distance from
the Missouri River was the shorter distance.</p>

<p>Davy was among those who turned out at daybreak
to watch for the first rider. He hustled down to the
stage station. The air was frosty, ice had formed
over night, and the sunrise was only a pink glow in the
east, beyond the expanse of rolling, sage-brush plain.
A group of stage and pony express employees and of
people from the post had gathered, wrapped in their
buffalo-robe coats and army coats, shivering in the
chill air, but waiting. By evidence of this group the
rider had not come; but the fresh horse was standing
saddled and bridled (he was the Kentucky thoroughbred),
and Irish Tom was also standing, ready, beside
it. Irish Tom wore a close-fitting leather jacket and
tight buckskin trousers, and boots and spurs and a
slouch hat tied down over his ears with a scarf. At
his belt were two revolvers and a knife; and slung
to his back was a Spencer carbine, which could fire
eight shots.</p>

<p>All eyes were directed down the trail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span></p>

<p>“He’s due,” spoke the station agent. And—</p>

<p>“There he comes!” shouted somebody. “There
he comes!”</p>

<p>“There he comes! Hurray! There he comes!”</p>

<p>Upon the dun sandy trail had appeared a black
speck. How rapidly it neared! Every eye was glued
to it; Irish Tom put foot into stirrup, hand upon
mane; his horse, as if knowing, pawed eagerly.</p>

<p>Now the speck had enlarged into a horseman,
rising, falling, rising, falling, upon galloping steed.
The horse itself was plain—and through the still thin
air floated the heralding beat of rapid hoofs.</p>

<p>The rider was leaning forward, lifting his mount
to its every stride; the horse’s head was stretched forward,
he was running low and hard, and now the steam
from his nostrils could be seen in great puffs. On
they swept, they two, man and horse, every second
nearer—and suddenly here they were, the horse’s
chest foam-specked, his nostrils wide and red, his legs
working forward and back, forward and back, his
rider a little fellow not much larger than Dave, crimson
faced from the swift pace through the cold night.
He swung his hat, and whooped, exultant. Up rose a
cheer to greet him; and the crowd scattered, for into
its very midst he galloped at full speed.</p>

<p>He jerked from underneath him a set of saddle-bags,
and ere he had stopped he flung them ahead;
the station agent sprang to grab them, and before the
rider had landed upon the ground had slung them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
across Irish Tom’s saddle and shouted: “Clear the
way!”</p>

<p>Into his saddle leaped Irish Tom, tightened lines,
thrust spurs against hide, and at a single great bound
was away, bending low and racing like mad at full
gallop on up the trail for Red Buttes, almost 100 miles
westward again. In an astonishingly brief space of
time he was around the turn and out of sight; but the
rapid thud of his hoofs still echoed back.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XXI">XXI<br />
<small>“PONY EXPRESS BILL”</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The name of the rider who had just arrived was
Charley Cliff. As he stiffly swung from the saddle, a
dozen hands were thrust at him to clap him on the
shoulder and to shake his hand in congratulation.</p>

<p>“What did you make it in?”</p>

<p>“What time is it?” he panted.</p>

<p>“You arrived at five ten.”</p>

<p>“Is that so? Then I made the last twenty miles in
sixty-two minutes.”</p>

<p>The horse looked like it. It staggered, weak-kneed,
as the hostler carefully led it to the stable. Charley also
slightly staggered from stiffness as he walked away
with the agent through a lane of admirers, for breakfast
and sleep.</p>

<p>Before the east-bound mail arrived on its swift
journey from California to the Missouri River, Davy
and everybody else at Laramie knew just how the
system was being worked. Charley had been well
questioned.</p>

<p>Only the best horses were used—horses that could
beat Indian horses or anything else on the road. The
Pony Express riders were supposed not to fight but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
to run away. Their Spencer carbine and two revolvers
and knife were carried for use only in case
that they couldn’t run away. They all had to sign the
regular Russell, Majors &amp; Waddell pledge, and each
one was given a calf-bound Bible, just as with the bull
trains. Small horses were preferred, and a very light
skeleton saddle was used. A set of saddle-bags called
a mochila (mo-cheela) was hung across the saddle; each
corner was a pocket for the mail. The pocket flaps
were locked by little brass keys, and could be unlocked
only by the station agents. The mochila was
passed from rider to rider, and the mail was taken out
or put in along the route. Of course, the most of the
mail was through mail, from the East to the Coast,
and from the Coast to the East. The rate was five
dollars a half ounce, and most of the letters were written
on tissue paper; the New York and St. Louis papers
also were to be printed on tissue paper for mailing by
the Pony Express. The limit was twenty pounds.
Charley thought that he had brought about three
pounds. The letters were wrapped in oiled silk, so
that they would not soak with water, and were in Government
Pony Express envelopes, which cost ten cents
apiece. Later Dave saw some of these letters, directed
to Laramie. Several addressed to the post sutler, for
instance, from merchant houses, had as much as
twenty dollars in postage stamps and Pony Express
stamps on the envelopes!</p>

<p>Gradually the names of the Pony Express riders<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
passed back and forth along the line. There were
eighty of the riders, forty carrying the news in one
direction, forty carrying it in the other. Out on the
west end—the Pacific Division—were riding Harry
Roff and “Boston,” and Sam Hamilton (through
thirty feet of snow on the Sierra Nevada mountain
range!) and Bob Haslam, and Jay Kelley, Josh Perkins,
Major Egan. In and out of Laramie rode Irish
Tom, and Charley Cliff, who was only seventeen years
old. In and out of Julesburg rode Bill Hogan, and
“Little Yank,” who weighed a hundred pounds and
rode 100 miles without a rest. Further east, down the
Platte, were Theo Rand and “Doc” Brink, and Jim
Beatley, and handsome Jim Moore, and little Johnny
Frye—who took the first trip out of St. Joe.</p>

<p>Their names and the names of other riders travelled
from mouth to mouth—and soon tales were being
told of storms and Indians and outlaws and accidents
that tried to stop the express but couldn’t. No
matter what conspired to stop him, the Pony Express
rider always got through. The first relays had carried
the mail from the Missouri River to Sacramento, California,
1966 miles, in nine days and twenty-three hours—one
hour under schedule! And after that the mail
went through, both ways, on schedule time or less.</p>

<p>So, regularly as clockwork, into Laramie galloped
the rider from Mud Springs, with the west-bound mail,
and the rider from Red Buttes with the east-bound
mail; in fifteen seconds the saddle bags were changed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
from horse to horse and out galloped the fresh riders.
Davy burned to vault aboard the saddle, like Irish Tom
or Charley, and scurry away, on business bent, to carry
the precious saddle bags to the next rider.</p>

<p>But meanwhile, where was Billy Cody?</p>

<p>The question was soon answered by Billy himself
when, one afternoon, into Fort Laramie pulled a Russell,
Majors &amp; Waddell bull outfit with Government
freight from Leavenworth; also with Billy Cody riding
beside Wagon Boss Lew Simpson! Never was sight
more welcome to Dave, who from the quartermaster’s
office espied the familiar figure and immediately rushed
out to give greeting.</p>

<p>Billy looked a little thin after the strenuous time
that he had had on the trapping expedition when he was
disabled and snowed in helpless; but he could shake
hands and exchange a “Hello,” before he swung from
his mule and made for Jack Slade.</p>

<p>Mr. Slade was division superintendent of the stage
and Pony Express, with headquarters at Horseshoe
Station, thirty-six miles west from Laramie. Just now
he was coming across the grounds and Billy stopped
him.</p>

<p>“How are you, Mr. Slade?”</p>

<p>“How are you?”</p>

<p>“My name’s Billy Cody, Mr. Slade. I want to
ride pony express. Mr. Russell’s sent me out to your
division with a letter.” And Billy extended the letter.</p>

<p>Mr. Slade was a straight, muscular, rather slender<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
man, with smooth-shaven face, high cheek-bones, cool,
steady gray eyes and thin straight lips. He had the
reputation of being a dangerous man in a fight, and
already he had driven Old Jules, down at Julesburg,
into hiding. He was rapidly cleaning his division of
outlaws and thieves.</p>

<p>Without opening the letter he scanned Billy from
head to foot. Billy stood stanch.</p>

<p>“You do, do you?” presently said Mr. Slade.
“You’re too young for a pony express rider, my boy.
It takes men for that business.”</p>

<p>Evidently he did not know Billy Cody.</p>

<p>“I rode a while on Bill Trotter’s division, sir,”
responded Billy, eagerly. “I filled the bill there, and
I think I can do as well or better now.”</p>

<p>Mr. Slade seemed interested.</p>

<p>“Oh! Are you that boy who was riding down there
a short time back, as the youngest rider on the road?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I’m the boy.”</p>

<p>Mr. Slade proceeded to read the Russell letter. It
must have recommended Billy highly, for Mr. Slade
appeared to be satisfied.</p>

<p>“All right,” he said. “I’ve heard of you. I
shouldn’t wonder if it would shake the life out of you,
but maybe you can stand it. I’ll give you a trial, anyhow;
and if you can’t stand up to it you can tend stock
at Horseshoe. I’ll let you know your run in the morning.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span></p>

<p>He walked away, and Billy turned to Dave with
face aglow.</p>

<p>“I’ve got it!” he asserted. “Hurrah! It’s on the
toughest division west of the mountains, too! I tell
you that’s no joke, riding pony express—making eighty
or a hundred miles at a dead gallop night and day, and
changing horses every ten miles or so in less than two
minutes.”</p>

<p>What luck! Or, no, not luck; Billy had earned it.
That evening Dave and he had a great old-time visit
exchanging news. Dave did not have much, it seemed
to him, worth while to report, but Billy was full of
adventures, as usual. Davy heard again all about the
trapping trip of last winter, and how another Dave—Dave
Harrington—had fought a heroic fight with the
snow to find Billy in the dug-out, and rescue him.
Billy was all right now; and after having had a short,
rather easy, pony express run down the line, was here
anxious to tackle something harder.</p>

<p>Mr. Slade went on to Horseshoe early the next
morning, but he saw Billy before he left, and Billy
got the assignment. He hailed Dave in high feather.</p>

<p>“I’m off,” he announced. “But I’m on, too. I’ve
got the run between Red Buttes and Three Crossings!
Seventy-six miles—about the hardest run on the
toughest division of the trail! Reckon maybe he thinks
he has my scalp, but he hasn’t. I’ll go through like
greased lightning. That’s an Injun and outlaw country
both; and I have to ford the Sweetwater three<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span>
times in sixty yards! Slade’s a hard man to work for,
too, they say. He won’t stand for any foolishness.
But I’ll get along with him all right as soon as he finds
out I do my duty. So long, Red. I’ll see you later.
You’ll hear from me, anyway. I told you I was going
to ride pony express, remember? I used to think I’d
be president; but I’d rather have this run than be boss
at Washington all the rest of my life!”</p>

<p>He hastily shook hands. Dave envied him heartily,
but he also wished him success. Nobody deserved success
more than Billy. Of course, to be the youngest
rider on the whole route from St. Joe to Sacramento
was a big thing, and nobody can blame Davy for a
trace of honest envy. He went back to his day’s
routine. The bull train pulled out at once, and Billy
started with it for his new job.</p>

<p>Soon word from him travelled back to Laramie
and Dave by Irish Tom, who received the saddle bags
from him at Red Buttes, and by Gentleman Bob, who
heard from him through the other stage drivers.
“Pony Express Bill” he began to be called; the “kid”
rider between Red Buttes and Three Crossings, on
the Platte and Sweetwater Rivers of the Salt Lake
Trail in what is to-day south central Wyoming but
which was then western Nebraska Territory.</p>

<p>Great things were reported of Billy. One time
when the rider west of him was killed, Billy rode his
own run and the other run, too, and all the way back<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
again—322 miles at a stretch! When Mr. Slade
learned of this he said: “That boy’s a brick!” and
he gave Billy extra pay.</p>

<p>Another time bandits stopped Billy and demanded
his express package, which they knew contained a large
sum of money. But Billy was smart. He had hidden
the real package under his saddle, and now he threw
them a dummy package containing only paper. When
they stooped to pick it up and examine it he spurred
his horse right over them and was away, flying up
the trail—and although they fired at him they never
touched him!</p>

<p>Another time the Sioux Indians ambushed him,
and when he dashed past they chased him. But he lay
flat on his pony’s back while the arrows whistled over
him, and he rode twenty-four miles without stopping.</p>

<p>Another time one bandit halted him in a lonely
canyon.</p>

<p>“You’re a mighty leetle fellow to be takin’ sech
chances,” said the bandit, while he held his gun pointed
at Billy’s head.</p>

<p>“I’m as big as any other fellow, I reckon,” answered
Billy, coolly.</p>

<p>“How do you figure that?” asked the bandit.</p>

<p>Billy tapped his Colt’s revolver.</p>

<p>“I may be little, but I can shoot as hard as if I
were General Jackson,” he warned.</p>

<p>“I expect you can, an’ I reckon you would,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span>
chuckled the bandit, tickled with Billy’s nerve; and he
let him ride on.</p>

<p>So it was not long before “Pony Express Bill”
was drawing $150 a month pay, which was the top
wages paid on the road.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Dave felt that his work at Fort Laramie
was rather tame. It was just the same thing day after
day, with only ordinary pay, and three meals a day,
and a good bed at night, and a lot of friends—and—and—that
seemed about all, except that he was learning
all the time from books and from the people about
him; and he knew that he was growing inside as well
as outside. To tell the truth, he was doing first-rate
and getting ahead, and was being given more and more
responsibility and showing that he could carry it;
but of course he wanted to prove his pluck by riding
pony express. That <em>seemed</em> bigger—whether it really
was or not.</p>

<p>His chance came, as it generally does to everybody
who waits for it and holds himself ready. All the
summer there had been talk among the army officers
at the post and between them and the stage passengers
who passed through of affairs in the East, where
a presidential campaign was being hotly carried on.
It appeared, by the talk and by the papers, that a man
named Abraham Lincoln was a candidate of the
North, and that Stephen A. Douglas was a candidate
of the South, and that if Mr. Lincoln was elected South<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
Carolina and other Southern States threatened to
withdraw from the Union. They claimed that each
State had the right of governing itself, and that States
and Territories should decide for themselves whether
or not they would own slaves within their borders.</p>

<p>The question as to whether Kansas should be
“slave” or “free” had caused fighting when that
territory was being settled; and Billy Cody’s father,
who was a “Free State” man, had been so badly
stabbed that he never recovered. The settlement of
Nebraska Territory also had brought on much bitter
feeling between North and South—for the North was
against the extension of slavery. So was Abraham
Lincoln. The army officers at Fort Laramie, some of
whom were Northerners and some Southerners, declared
that the election of Lincoln would mean war;
according to the Northern officers, if the Southern
States tried to withdraw; according to the Southern
officers, if the Southern States were not permitted to
withdraw.</p>

<p>The election was to be held on November 6, and it
would be November 10 before the news of who won
could reach Laramie by the Pony Express. That
was a long time at the best when such important events
were occurring; but even at that Davy (who was as
impatient as anybody) found that he might be disappointed,
for he was ordered by Captain Brown to
take the stage west in the morning and go up the line
to Horseshoe Station on Government business.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span></p>

<p>When the stage left, early, Irish Tom was still
standing ready beside his horse to take the saddle bag
from Charley Cliff. Charley had not come—and it
was learned afterward that the mail was late in starting
from St. Joseph because it had waited for the
election news.</p>

<p>So Dave mounted the driver’s box on the C. O. C.
&amp; P. P. stage beside Gentleman Bob, and they drove
away and left the unknown news behind them.</p>

<p>However, not for long. They had gone scarcely
fifteen miles when Gentleman Bob, who had been constantly
glancing over his shoulder, exclaimed: “There
he comes! Look at him, will you!”</p>

<p>By “he” could be meant only one person—the
Pony Express rider. Yes, the Pony Express it
was—a dark spot, rising, falling, rising, falling, pelting
up the dusty trail.</p>

<p>“He’s certainly going some,” commented the stage
messenger, who this time was not Captain Cricket, but
was Jack Mayfield.</p>

<p>Bob flung his lash over the backs of his four mules
and broke them into a gallop. But although the stage
was empty this trip and the mules fresh, and the road
smooth, the pony express closed in as fast as if the
coach were standing still.</p>

<p>“Going to pass us,” laughed Bob, and slowed his
team.</p>

<p>And the pony express <em>did</em> pass them. There was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
sudden staccato of hoofs, like a long roll of a drum—a
rush, a whoop—“Who’s elected?” yelled Bob,
turning in his seat to meet the onswoop.</p>

<p>“Lincoln. New York gives fifty thousand majority,”
shouted back Irish Tom; and in a cloud of
dust he was away, leaving a flake of froth on the coach
box at Davy’s feet.</p>

<p>“Lincoln, huh?” remarked Gentleman Bob.
“Well, I wonder what’ll happen now. But that boy’s
sure riding,” and he gazed reflectively after Irish Tom.</p>

<small>CARRYING THE GREAT NEWS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Lincoln’s elected!” The words continued to
ring in Davy’s ears, and the flying shape of the Pony
Express, bearing the great news, was constantly in his
eyes as at trot and gallop the stage rolled along the
Salt Lake Overland trail from Fort Laramie on. Irish
Tom and his hard pushed pony were out of sight, but
they were not forgotten.</p>

<p>The trail was almost deserted this morning; only
one emigrant train was passed, and, drawing aside
to let the stage by, it cheered to the three persons on
the box: “Hooray for Lincoln!”</p>

<p>Davy cheered back; but Gentleman Bob and Messenger
Mayfield looked straight ahead and said
nothing. That was the fashion. Emigrant trains and
bull trains were considered beneath the notice of the
stage coach box.</p>

<p>However, in another mile something did attract
the notice of Gentleman Bob, whose eyes were ever
on the lookout, although he usually spoke little.</p>

<p>“Looks like trouble, yonder,” he remarked, pointing
with his whip. “How’s your gun, Jack? O. K.?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span></p>

<p>“Better have it ready. Red, you get down in the
boot under the seat and stay there, when I say so.
You’re liable to be shot full of holes.”</p>

<p>Bob gathered his lines tighter and peered keenly.
His jaw set, as, holding up his mules, prepared for
sudden dash, he sent them forward at brisk trot.
Messenger Mayfield shifted his short double-barrelled
gun loaded with buckshot from between his knees to
his lap and pulled down his hat.</p>

<p>Half a mile before, in the hollow of the sweeping
curve which the coach was rounding, was a riderless
horse moving restlessly hither-thither in the brush beside
the trail; he was equipped with saddle and bridle—at
least so Bob muttered, and so the messenger agreed,
and so Davy believed that he, also, could see—but of
the rider there was no sign <em>yet</em>.</p>

<p>Indians! Then why hadn’t they taken the horse?
Or road agents, as the bandits were called! The rider
must have been shot from the saddle. And would
the coach, passing, find him? Or were the Indians,
surprised in the act, ambushed and waiting? Or what
<em>had</em> happened, anyway?</p>

<p>“That’s the Pony Express horse, gentleman,” said
Bob, quietly. “I know the animal. There’s been bad
work.”</p>

<p>Mr. Mayfield, who was as nervy as Bob himself,
nodded; Davy breathed faster, his heart beating
loudly; Bob flung his lash, straightened out his team,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span>
and with brake slightly grinding descended the hill at
a gallop.</p>

<p>“I see him!” exclaimed Messenger Mayfield.
“At the edge of the road. He’s hurt, but he can
move.”</p>

<p>Davy, too, could see a dismounted man—Irish Tom
or somebody else—half raising himself from the
ground, and crawling into the trail, where he sat waving
his handkerchief.</p>

<p>With rattle and shuffle and grinding of brake the
coach bore down, prepared to stop—and prepared for
anything else that might befall.</p>

<p>Yes, it was Irish Tom, the Pony Express rider, and
that was his horse, the saddle bags still on it, fidgeting
in the brush. Tom was half lying, half sitting, supporting
himself with one arm and waving with the
other. His hat was gone, his uplifted hand bleeding,
one leg seemed useless, and altogether he appeared in
a sad state.</p>

<p>In a cloud of dust from the braced hoofs and
locked wheels Gentleman Bob halted with the leaders’
fore hoofs almost touching Tom.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter here?”</p>

<p>Tom’s face, grimy and streaked and pinched with
pain, gazed up agonizedly, but he did not mince words.
The Pony Express rider was superior even to a stage
driver.</p>

<p>“Catch that horse for me. I’ve broken my leg.”</p>

<p>Down from the box nimbly swung Mr. Mayfield;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span>
jamming his brakes tighter and tying the lines short,
down swung Gentleman Bob. Down clambered Dave.</p>

<p>“How’d it happen?”</p>

<p>“Fell and threw me. Catch him and help me on;
and hurry up.”</p>

<p>“Catch him, Jack; you and Dave,” bade Bob,
crisply. “Where’s it broken, Tom?”</p>

<p>“High up, but that doesn’t matter. I’ll ride if it
kills me. I’m late now.”</p>

<p>Luckily the horse was easily caught; his dragging
lines, entangled in a sage clump, held him until Mr.
Mayfield laid hand upon them. When Dave, with Mr.
Mayfield leading the horse, returned into the road
and hustled back to Bob and Tom, Bob was arguing
tensely.</p>

<p>“But you can’t, Tom! You can’t do it, man! You
can’t fork a saddle with your hip broken.”</p>

<p>Tom struggled to sit up—and the great beads of
sweat stood out on his red brow.</p>

<p>“You help me on, and tie me there; that’s all I
ask. I’ll make it. I’ve <em>got</em> to.”</p>

<p>“We’ll take you on to the next station, and the
saddle bags, too,” retorted Bob. “That’s the quickest
way. Strip that horse, Red. Give me a lift with Tom,
here, Jack. Open the coach door.”</p>

<p>“But there’s nobody except the agent at the next
station, Bob!” appealed Tom, wildly. “Who’ll take
the express?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[309]</span></p>

<p>“Then we’ll go through to the next station. They
can send somebody from there, I reckon.”</p>

<p>Suddenly a great thought struck Davy—and he
wondered why the same hadn’t occurred to the others.</p>

<p>“I’ll ride it, Tom! I’ll ride it, Bob! Let <em>me</em>.”
And he sprang for the express pony.</p>

<p>Bob slapped his dusty thigh: The idea struck him.</p>

<p>“Go it,” he exclaimed. “Take those lines. Unbuckle
your guns, Tom, old man, while I hold you.”</p>

<p>“Somebody put my spurs on him,” panted Tom,
tugging at his belt buckle.</p>

<p>Words had been rapid, fingers worked fast; and
almost in less time than it takes to tell it, after the
halting of the coach, Davy was in the Pony Express
saddle, with the final orders filling his ears.</p>

<p>“Now ride, boy; ride!”</p>

<p>Scarcely yet settled into the stirrups, he bounded
forward (the jerk of the mettlesome pony almost
snapped his head loose), and was away.</p>

<p>“Ride, boy; ride!”</p>

<p>Davy jammed tighter his hat; his feet clinging to the
stirrups, he half turned in the saddle and waved his
hand to the little group behind. They would see that
he was all right. They were grouped just as he had left
them: Mr. Mayfield standing, where he had strapped
the spurs to Davy’s heels after Dave had mounted;
Gentleman Bob half erect, over Tom, from whom he
had passed the revolver belt.</p>

<p>But even as Davy looked, they all moved, preparing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span>
to lift Tom into the coach. Davy faced ahead and
settled to his work.</p>

<p>“Ride, boy; ride!”</p>

<p>Well, he <em>could</em> ride! he knew how; and if he didn’t
know how he was bound to stick, anyway. There were
the plump saddle bags under him, crossed by his legs;
he was carrying the fast mail—and Lincoln was
elected!</p>

<p>The pony ran without a break and needed no urging.
He was trained to his work—a stanch, swift, apparently
tireless animal. The wind smote Davy in the
face, bringing water to his eyes; the sandy, beaten
trail flowed backward beneath them like a dun torrent,
the sage and rocks reeled dizzily past on either hand,
and amidst the rhythmic beat of hoofs the pony’s
breaths rose to snorty grunts.</p>

<p>Now another emigrant train for Salt Lake City
and the Mormon colony dotted the trail before. Past
them thudded Dave, and as he raced down the line he
yelled shrilly:</p>

<p>“Lincoln’s elected! Lincoln’s elected!”</p>

<p>“By how much?”</p>

<p>“New York gives him fifty thousand!”</p>

<p>Dave was not certain what this conveyed, exactly,
but it had sounded important from Irish Tom.</p>

<p>Some of the train cheered, some growled, but he
speedily left both cheers and growls behind him.</p>

<p>The first of the stations appeared ahead—a blot
of darker drab beside the trail. This was one of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>[311]</span>
way stations—the stations where horses were changed
in less than two minutes. Two minutes was the limit,
but frequently the change was made in fifteen seconds.</p>

<p>Dave’s pony seemed to know where he was and
what was at hand. He snorted, and at pick of spur
let himself out a little longer in his stride and doubled
and stretched a little faster.</p>

<p>The station swiftly enlarged. A poor place it was,
Dave remembered: a low log cabin, sod roofed, with
rude log stable close behind it, and a pole corral. The
station man would be about as rude in appearance:
unshaven, well weathered, dressed in slouch hat, rough
flannel shirt, red or blue, belted trousers and heavy
boots. There he lived, by the roadside, 700 miles into
the Indian country, alone amidst the unpeopled, rolling
sagy hills through which flowed the North Platte
River and extended, unending, the ribbon-like road.
Dave could see him standing in front of the buildings,
holding the relay horse and peering down the trail for
its rider. The stations were required by the company
to have the fresh horse saddled and bridled and ready
half an hour before the express was due.</p>

<p>Dave knew his duty, too. Not slackening pace, he
loosened from the fastenings the saddle bags under
him. Up at full gallop he dashed, and even before
he had pulled his pony to its haunches, he tore the
saddle bags from beneath him and tossed them ahead.
Then he was off in a twinkling, staggering as he landed.</p>

<p>“Quick!” he gasped, out of parched throat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span></p>

<p>The station man had stared, but he grabbed the
saddle bags.</p>

<p>“Who are you? Where’s Tom?”</p>

<p>“Hurt. Coming on stage.”</p>

<p>The saddle bags were clapped on the other saddle.
Dave grasped the bridle lines.</p>

<p>“Bad?”</p>

<p>“Leg broken.” And Davy, thrusting foot into
stirrup, vaulted aboard almost over the station man’s
head.</p>

<p>One last twitch to the saddle bags.</p>

<p>“What’s the news?”</p>

<p>“Lincoln’s elected. New York gives him fifty
thousand majority.” And away sprang Dave, headlong
on the next leg of his route.</p>

<p>Thudding through the sand, clattering over the
rocks, echoing through short defiles, ever urging his
pony, rode Davy. He was resolved to go clear through,
to the home station at Red Buttes, over sixty miles.
The stations ahead had no means of knowing that an
accident had befallen the regular rider; and to mount
another substitute, at short notice, would consume valuable
time. At Red Buttes Billy Cody would take the
saddle bags—and to give them to Billy he must.</p>

<p>At the next station, fourteen miles, the station man
had helpers in the shape of two hostlers or stable
hands. They also gazed, astonished at sight of Dave
instead of Irish Tom; but no one wasted precious moments
in explanations. The conversation was much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span>
the same as before—and on his fresh horse Dave
spurred again up the long, long trail. He passed a
toiling bull train. “Lincoln’s elected,” he shrieked as
before; but he was going so fast that he did not catch
their response. He only noted them wave their whips
in salute.</p>

<p>Horseshoe Station hove into view. This was headquarter’s
station for the division. Here stayed, when
not on the trail, Mr. Slade, the division superintendent;
and he was in front of the station cabin with the
other men, peering down the road.</p>

<p>Davy galloped in. He was assailed by a volley of
queries—until Mr. Slade cut them short.</p>

<p>“No matter,” he bade curtly. “Fasten that
mochila. Now ride, my lad; you’re half an hour late!”</p>

<p>“Lincoln’s elected,” gasped Davy, spurring away.</p>

<p>He was getting tired. His feet were growing
numb, and his ankles were being chafed raw. Before
he arrived at the next station, the Platte River had to
be forded. As he passed through, a man sprang into
sight, in the trail at the farther bank. Dave’s heart
leaped into his throat. The man was partially screened
by willows. He was armed. With ears pricked, the
horse forged ahead, and the man waited. To leave
the stream bed required a little climb up the rather
steep bank, and as Dave reached it out whipped the
man’s revolver and the muzzle was trained true at
Dave. It seemed to him that the round hole covered
every inch of his body. His horse shied and balked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[314]</span></p>

<p>“Throw off that mail bag.”</p>

<p>The man was “Yank,” assistant wagon boss
under Charley Martin! Dave recognized him at once,
although the slouch hat was pulled low. But beneath
the brim the eyes were those of “Yank.”</p>

<p>“No,” panted Dave, trying to hold his voice steady
and think of what Billy Cody or Irish Tom would do.
“It’s only election news.”</p>

<p>“Throw off that mail and be quick, too,” ordered
“Yank,” with a string of curses.</p>

<p>Hardly knowing what he did, but resolved to do
something, Dave plunged his spurs into his pony’s
heaving flanks. With a great snort and a long leap
the pony lunged forward straight up the bank.
“Yank” uttered a sudden vicious exclamation and
dived aside; but the horse’s shoulder struck him, hurled
him aside, and at the instant veering sharply into the
fringe of willows Dave sent his mount crashing
through. The willows slapped him in the face and on
the body. He bent low—in a moment more they were
out of the willows, again into the trail, and tearing
onward. He heard a shot—just one; but the bullet
went wide, and thudity, thudity, he was galloping safe.
A little shaky, Dave laughed; he felt like giving a
whoop—although he could not spare breath for even
that. He imagined, though, how mad “Yank” must
be, and this was what had made him laugh.</p>

<p>Even with the excitement of the hold-up that failed,
the road began to seem wearisome, the ride one monotonous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[315]</span>
pound. The chafing stirrups tortured his ankles
almost beyond endurance—but not quite; no, not quite.
The saddle chafed his thighs. His mouth was parched,
he could scarcely breathe; he could scarcely see, when,
ever and anon, his head swam giddily. He forded
the river again. From throbbing pain, his ankles
changed to the relief of numbness, and his feet, blistered,
and his blistered thighs gradually ceased to be
his; they felt as if they belonged to somebody else.</p>

<p>He had vague recollection of arriving at the way
stations, of staggering from horse to horse, of being
helped into the saddle, of voices hailing him, and hands
and voices forwarding him on again. Once he passed
the east-bound stage—and again he passed it, or another:
and he piped to the staring faces: “Lincoln’s
elected. New York gives fifty thousand majority.”
The words issued mechanically, and he did not know
what effect they had.</p>

<p>He had vague recollection that a bevy of Indians
yelled at him and flourished their bows, and that he
heard the hiss of arrows travelling even faster than
he; but he could not stop to argue. The one fact that
stuck in his mind was that he was nearly on time.
“Three minutes late,” he thought that somebody said
at the last station where he changed horses. And—“Go
it, lad! You’re a plucky one.”</p>

<p>“Three minutes late” was all. The thought buoyed
him up and glued him to his saddle. Gallop, gallop,
over rock and sand, through brush and through the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"></a>[316]</span>
bare open and through occasional scrubby growth of
trees; through shaded canyons, and through the burning,
windy sunshine.</p>

<p>Was that Red Buttes? Was that really Red
Buttes at last—the end of his trip, where waited Billy
Cody? Supposing Billy wasn’t there; would they want
<em>him</em> to continue riding, riding, forever? He uttered
a little sob of despair, but he set his teeth hard, and
resolved that he’d do it; he’d do it, if he <em>had</em> to.</p>

<p>The road was hilly and his horse flagged. He
spurred ruthlessly and struck with his hat. If he did
not arrive on time he would be ashamed, for nobody
could know how hard he had tried. Up the hill he
forced his pony and would not let him relax into a
trot. Down the grade he galloped—every forward
jump a torment. Red Buttes—that <em>must</em> be Red
Buttes—wavered strangely amidst the level expanse
before. But he reached it. At least he thought that
he reached it, and he fumbled at his saddle bags to
loosen them.</p>

<p>Somebody rushed forward as if to meet him and
help him; and he saw, lined plainly amidst the confused
other countenances and figures, the astonished face of
Billy.</p>

<p>“It’s Red! Look out! He’ll fall off!” Billy’s
voice rang like a trumpet.</p>

<p>“Where’s the regular man?” they demanded.</p>

<p>“Tom’s hurt—away back. I took his place.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span>
Quick, Billy! Go on. Election news. Lincoln’s
elected.”</p>

<p>Billy vented an exclamation. He was into the
saddle atop the saddle bags; he sprang away.</p>

<p>“Take good care of that kid,” he called back.
“He’s a good one.”</p>

<p>“You bet we will.”</p>

<p>“Am I on time?” wheezed Davy, vaguely, unable
to see straight.</p>

<p>“Two minutes ahead of time, lad.”</p>

<p>Then they picked up Davy and carried him in,
for he had fallen. He felt that he was entitled to fall.
Besides, he could not have walked to save his life, now
that he was done with the saddle bags.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XXIII">XXIII<br />
<small>A BRUSH ON THE OVERLAND STAGE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Davy was so stiff and sore that for several days
he moved around very little; but he learned that the
news which he had brought in was being rushed westward
at a tremendous rate. Billy Cody had ridden
the last ten miles of his own run in thirty minutes;
and by special rider from Julesburg the tidings “Lincoln’s
elected!” had been taken into Denver only two
days and twenty-one hours out of St. Joseph—665
miles.</p>

<p>When Davy was on his way back to Laramie he
heard, at Horseshoe Station, that the news had been
carried through to California in eight days—two days
less than schedule! That was riding! And although
he never again was on Pony Express, he felt that to the
end of his life he would be proud of having ridden it
once and of having performed well.</p>

<p>The people at Fort Laramie appreciated what Davy
had done, and if he had not been a sensible boy the
praise that he got would have turned his head. Captain
Brown it was who summoned him over to the
Brown quarters one evening and asked flatly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319"></a>[319]</span></p>

<p>“Dave, how would you like to go to West Point
and be educated for a soldier?”</p>

<p>Dave gulped, in surprise, and blushed red. Such
an education had been beyond his dreams.</p>

<p>“You have the right stuff in you, boy,” continued
the captain, eyeing him. “You’ve made a good start,
but you can’t continue knocking around this way.
The frontier won’t last forever. When the telegraph
comes through, connecting the West with the East,
the Pony Express will have to quit; and there’ll soon
be a railroad, and then the stage coach business will
have to quit. If we have war (and things look like
it), I’ll be ordered out; so will the other officers and
men here, and what will happen to you is a problem.
See? If you want to go to West Point you ought to
begin preparing, so as to be ready when you’re old
enough to enter. It’s no easy matter to take the course
at the Academy; but it’s the finest education in the
world, even if you don’t stay in the army. I don’t want
you to go there with the idea of being a fighting man.
Army officers are the last persons of all to wish for
fighting. The army has a great work to do outside
of war. We’re supposed to civilize the country and
keep it peaceful. At West Point your body is built
up, and what you learn, you learn thoroughly. You
come out fit to meet every kind of emergency. What
do you say? If you say ‘yes,’ then I’ll make application
for you to the President direct and ask him to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320"></a>[320]</span>
appoint you ‘at large,’ as he has a right to do, just as
if you were my own son.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” stammered Davy, red. “I’d like to
go.”</p>

<p>“Good!” exclaimed the captain, shaking with him.
“I’ll make arrangements so that if I’m ordered out
you’ll be in the right hands.”</p>

<p>Events seemed to occur fast. By Pony Express
dispatches and the tissue newspapers it was learned
that South Carolina had withdrawn from the Union
and that the other Southern States were following
suit. Abraham Lincoln in his inauguration address
besought peace but stood firmly for a United States.
His address was carried from Saint Joseph to Sacramento,
1966 miles, in seven days and seventeen hours—a
new record. But when arrived the word that
on April 12 the South Carolina troops had bombarded
Fort Sumter, then everybody knew that the war had
begun.</p>

<p>Another important thing, also, occurred. Before
spring a stranger who created considerable talk came
through by stage bound west. He was Mr. Edward
Creighton—a pleasant gentleman with an Irish face;
and was on his way to Salt Lake looking over the
country with a view to putting in a telegraph line
through to Salt Lake City. A California company was
to build from California east to Salt Lake and it was
rumored that the Government offered a payment of
$40,000 a year to the company that reached Salt Lake<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321"></a>[321]</span>
the first. This meant, of course, a line clear across
from the Missouri to the Pacific coast.</p>

<p>In the hurly-burly of troops preparing to leave for
the front in the East, Davy had the idea that he, too,
should go as a drummer boy, maybe. The sight of
Billy Cody hurrying through was hard to bear.</p>

<p>Billy appeared unexpectedly on the stage from
Horseshoe Station, where he had been an “extra”
rider under direct orders of Superintendent Jack
Slade himself.</p>

<p>“Hello, Billy!”</p>

<p>“Hello, Dave.”</p>

<p>“Where are you going now, Billy?”</p>

<p>“Back home. I haven’t been home for a year, and
my mother wants to see me. She’s poorly again. I
guess I’d better be where things are boiling, too. This
war won’t last more than six months, they say; but
Kansas is liable to be a hot place with so many Southerners
just across the border in Missouri. I ought to
be on hand in case of trouble around home.”</p>

<p>That was just like Billy—to be on hand! Dave
had more than half a mind to accompany him to
Leavenworth, and Captain Brown, about to leave himself,
had about decided that Leavenworth would be the
best place, when the matter was solved by the appearance
of the Reverend Mr. Baxter, who arrived on the
next stage from the west.</p>

<p>“Gee whillikins!” exclaimed Dave, overjoyed,
rushing to meet him. “What are <em>you</em> doing here?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322"></a>[322]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, merely coming through on my way from
Salt Lake back to Denver,” laughed Mr. Baxter. “I’m
messenger on the stage between Julesburg and Denver,
but I’ve been off on a little vacation with a survey
party for a new stage road. I heard you were here.
You’re celebrated since you made that splendid ride,
Davy.”</p>

<p>Davy blushed again. He hated to blush, but he
had to.</p>

<p>“What are you doing these days?” demanded Mr.
Baxter.</p>

<p>As soon as he heard of Davy’s plans and present
fix, he insisted that Davy travel down to Denver with
him and stay there.</p>

<p>“Room with me, Dave?” he proffered generously.
“I need a bunky. You can get work easy enough—I
know the very place where they can use a boy who
can write and figure—and I’ll tutor you. It will do
me good to brush up a little in mathematics and all
that.”</p>

<p>Captain Brown agreed, and the matter was
promptly settled. Away went Dave, and the next day
Captain Brown himself left for Fort Leavenworth,
and then—where? His going would have made Laramie
rather empty for Dave.</p>

<p>Denver had grown amazingly. There was now no
“Auraria”; all was Denver City—and what had been
known as “Western Kansas” and the “Territory of
Jefferson,” was the Territory of Colorado. On both<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323"></a>[323]</span>
sides of Cherry Creek many new buildings, two and
three stories, some of the buildings being brick, had
gone up; potatoes and other produce were being raised,
and the streets, busier than ever, were thronged with
merchants and other real citizens, as well as with
miners and bull whackers.</p>

<p>Mr. Baxter took Davy over to see the lots that they
had bought for the sack of flour two years before.
Then, the lots had been out on the very edge of town;
now they were right in the business district. The
Jones family had not cared for them; had sold them
for a mere song and had pushed on to “get rich
quick” mining. The Joneses had gone back to the
States, poor; but the lost lots were being held by the
present owners at $1000 apiece.</p>

<p>Mr. Baxter made good his promise, and Dave
found a niche (which appeared to have been made
especially for a red-headed boy, with spunk, who could
read and write as well as take care of himself on the
trail) in the Elephant Corral. This was a large store
building and yard for the convenience of merchants
and overland traffic. It dealt in flour and feed and
other staples consigned to it, and was headquarters
for bull outfits arriving and leaving.</p>

<p>The war excitement continued. Colorado, like
Kansas and Nebraska, sent out its volunteers in response
to the calls of President Lincoln. Mr. Baxter
tried hard to be accepted as a chaplain, but the examining<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324"></a>[324]</span>
surgeons refused him, he confided to Davy,
because he had a “bum lung.”</p>

<p>“So, Davy boy,” he said, “you and I will have to
fight the battle of peace, and win our honors there,
at present.”</p>

<p>They heard that Captain Brown had been made
a general, and Billy Cody and Wild Bill, too, were
serving on the Union side as scouts and despatch
bearers in Kansas and Missouri. As for Davy, he
pegged along, rooming and boarding with Mr. Baxter,
doing his work at the Elephant Corral and studying
evenings.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the staging and freighting across the
plains and to Salt Lake continued, when not interrupted
by the Indians. The Butterfield “Southern
Overland,” through Texas and New Mexico and
Arizona to California, which had been carrying the
Government mail for two years, had to be discontinued
on account of the war and the Apache Indians;
and the contract was given to the “Central” route,
operated by Russell, Majors &amp; Waddell. This meant
$400,000 a year from the Government, and it looked
as though the Central Overland, California &amp; Pike’s
Peak need no longer be called the “Clean Out of Cash
&amp; Poor Pay”; but soon the word came that the whole
line had been bought in by a big creditor, Ben Holladay.</p>

<p>Great things were expected of Ben Holladay. Dave
had seen him once or twice—a large, heavy man, with
square, resolute face; clean-shaven cheeks, and gray<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325"></a>[325]</span>
beard. He was a veteran freighter and trader on the
plains, and had been in business in Salt Lake, California,
St. Louis and New York, and was a hustler.
He hastened to increase the service of his stage line.
No expense or trouble was too much for him. The
line was known now as “Ben Holladay’s Line,” and
“The Overland Stage.” The old route north from
Julesburg and around by Fort Laramie was changed
to a shorter route (the route which Mr. Baxter had
helped survey for Russell, Majors &amp; Waddell at the
time when he picked up Dave at Laramie), which from
Latham, sixty miles north of Denver, veering northwest
crossed the mountains at Bridger’s Pass for Salt
Lake. At Salt Lake the celebrated Pioneer Stage Line
continued with passengers and mail and express for
Placerville, California.</p>

<p>The very fall after Dave arrived in Denver Mr.
Creighton finished his telegraph line into Salt Lake
City, and won the $40,000 a year prize offered by the
Government. The California company met him there;
the first message was flashed through from coast to
coast (“The Pacific to the Atlantic sends greeting,”
it said; “and may both oceans be dry before a foot of
all the land that lies between shall belong to any other
than a united country”); and, as Captain Brown had
predicted, the Pony Express must stop. The Holladay
stages carried the mails.</p>

<p>Every morning at eight o’clock sharp they left
Atchison below St. Joseph on the Missouri River;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326"></a>[326]</span>
at Latham the Salt Lake coaches proceeded on to Salt
Lake and the Denver coaches turned south to Denver—and
usually got in with such regularity that Denver
people set their watches by them! There never had
been such a stage coach magnate as Ben Holladay.
His six- and nine-passenger Concord coaches were the
best that could be built—and on the main line alone
he used 100. His horses were the best that could be
bought—and of these and of mules he had, on the
main line, 3000. His drivers were paid the best salaries—$125
and $150 a month. And for carrying the
mails he received from the Government $650,000 a
year. When, several times a year, he went over his
whole lines he travelled like a whirlwind and caused a
tremendous commotion.</p>

<p>But speedily the regular operation of the Holladay
Overland Express was badly interrupted, for the Indians
began to ravage up and down. All the way
from central Kansas to the mountains they destroyed
stations and attacked stages. The stages ran two at
a time, for company, and were protected by squads
of soldiers; but even then they did not always get
through, and Denver was cut off from the outside
world for weeks at a time. Whenever Mr. Baxter
started out as messenger Dave was afraid that he
would not come back alive; but somehow he managed
to make the trip, although he was apt to return in a
coach riddled with arrows and bullets.</p>

<p>The summer of 1864, when Davy was almost seventeen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327"></a>[327]</span>
and old enough to enter the Military Academy,
was the worst season of all for Indian raids. Stations
and ranches for hundreds of miles at a stretch were
pillaged, and the stages ceased altogether between the
mountains and the Missouri. Then, in the fall, there
came a lull—of which Dave was heartily glad, for he
had been ordered to report at Fort Leavenworth for
examination. His appointment had come, signed by
Abraham Lincoln.</p>

<p>“I’ll see you through to Atchison, Dave,” said
Mr. Baxter; “and to Leavenworth, too. The return
trip will be my last run.”</p>

<p>“Why so, Ben?” asked Davy, astonished.</p>

<p>“Because I’m going to change to a more permanent
business while I can. The railways are coming. The
Central Pacific’s building a little every year east out
of California, and as soon as the war’s over the Union
Pacific will start from its end, at the Missouri. When
the two roads meet, with trains running across the
continent, this staging business will be knocked flat,
and we messengers will be stranded. I’ve got my
health now; I’m as good a man as anybody, and when
I get back from Atchison I’ll go into something different.
I’ve several offers pending. See?”</p>

<p>That sounded like sense; but Dave was pleased
that Mr. Baxter had not quit before this trip, for he
had counted on going out in Ben’s coach.</p>

<p>The fare from Denver to the Missouri River was
up to $175, but Davy had saved this, and more. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328"></a>[328]</span>
stages left from the Planters’ Hotel. The first stage
out, after the long interruption, created much excitement.
At least fifty passengers clamored for places,
but there was room for only nine in the body—and
even they were crowded by mail sacks. Dave sat on
the driver’s box with Ben and the driver, who was
Bob Hodge.</p>

<p>Everybody on the line knew Bob Hodge; he was one
of the “king whips,” and very popular. The Holladay
stage drivers out of the principal stations dressed
the best that they could, for they were persons of consequence.
Polished boots, broadcloth trousers tucked
in, soft silk shirts with diamond stud, rakish hat and
kid gloves were none too good for them. Bob wore a
suit of buckskin—with its decorations of beads and
fringes, the finest suit in Denver. As he stepped from
the hotel he elegantly drew on a pair of new yellow
kid gloves. He nodded to Ben and Dave, and tucked
a brass horn, which was his pride, in the seat. On this
horn he was accustomed to perform when he wanted
amusement and when he approached stations. His
other pride was his whip—of ebony handle inlaid with
silver. All the Holladay stage drivers owned their
whips and would not lend them.</p>

<p>Bob climbed aboard, Ben and Dave followed. Two
hostlers held the six-horse team by the bits; another
handed up the lines to Bob—who condescended to receive
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329"></a>[329]</span></p>

<p>“Think she’ll get through, Bob?” queried several
voices, referring to the coach.</p>

<p>“Oh, I reckon. She’s been through several times
before,” drawled Bob.</p>

<p>And by the looks of “her,” she evidently had been
through something. It had been a beautiful coach, in
the beginning, painted a glossy bright green, trimmed
with gilt; but now it was scarred by storm and Indians.
The very boot curtain behind Dave’s feet was punctured
in two places by arrows, and there were other
holes through the coach sides.</p>

<p>Bob glanced at his gold watch. He grasped lines
and whip, nodded at the hostlers (they sprang from the
leaders’ bits), released the heavy brake with a bang;
to the crack of his whip forward leaped the six gray
horses, whose harness was adorned with ivory rings.
The watching crowd gave a cheer, and, driving with
one hand, Bob played what he called “Into the Wilderness.”</p>

<p>Bob’s run was only to Latham, sixty miles down
the Platte. Here he descended, in lordly fashion, from
his seat—and out of the coach must issue the passengers,
much to their disgust. The mails from the
west had been piling up for six weeks, and were of more
importance than people. Forty-one sacks were stored
aboard by the station agent, until the coach was heaped
to the roof, and the big boot was overflowing. The
coach now carried a ton of mail—and Ben, Davy and
the driver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330"></a>[330]</span></p>

<p>Express messengers rode an entire division, such
as between Atchison and Denver, between Denver and
Salt Lake, and between Salt Lake and Placerville of
California. So Ben continued on, with Dave as his
guest. The new driver was “Long Slim”—another
odd character. “Long Slim” was six feet three inches
tall, and so thin that he claimed when he stood sideways
he wouldn’t cast a shadow. He was much different
from dandy Bob Hodge; for he wore cowhide
boots, a blue army overcoat, and a buffalo fur cap.</p>

<p>Long Slim drove to Bijou Station, and here another
driver took charge. Stage drivers drove forty or
fifty miles, or from “home” station to “home”
station. In between, about every ten miles, were the
“swing” stations, where the teams were changed.
Meals were served at the home stations.</p>

<p>The change of drivers was interesting, and really
made little difference to Dave, for none of them talked
much; and as the coach rolled further eastward into
the Indian country the talk was less and less. At the
swing stations the teams were always standing, harnessed
and waiting. The driver grandly tossed down
the lines and yawned; the old team was whisked out
in a jiffy, the new team trotted into place without being
told, the station men handed up the lines to the box,
and away went the stage again.</p>

<p>At the home stations the driver—“Long Slim,”
or “Deacon,” or “Dad,” or “Mizzou,” or whatever
he was called, followed his lines to the ground, said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331"></a>[331]</span>
(if he chose): “All quiet so far, Hank,” and strolled
into the station. If he mentioned a drink of water,
half the station force rushed to get it for him. He was
a king, was the driver on the Overland Stage!</p>

<p>At Bijou Station, six soldiers of the Colorado cavalry
picked up the stage and escorted it, riding three
on a side, for about 100 miles. At least they were
there when Davy peeked out of the boot under the
driver’s seat, where he slept, curled in a ball, very comfortably,
while the coach rocked and swayed through
the night.</p>

<p>The Seventh Iowa Cavalry next took the stage,
galloping and trotting beside it down the trail along
the Platte River.</p>

<p>The stage stations and the ranches looked as if
they had been having a tough time. Most of the ranch
buildings were in ruins and abandoned; many of the
stage stations had been burned, and the station men
were living in dug-outs, some of which were merely
holes in the ground, roofed over with a pile of dirt
loop-holed for rifles. Meals at the home stations were
$1.50, cooked by the station agents’ brave wives or
by the men themselves. Some of the meals were very
poor, too—and some astonishingly good.</p>

<p>All went well with the stage until between Cottonwood
and Fort Kearney the driver, who was known
as “Waupsie,” pointed to the south with his whip.</p>

<p>“There they are,” he said quietly; and instantly
flung out his lash.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332"></a>[332]</span></p>

<p>The silken snapper cracked like a pistol shot, and
out launched the team. Down from a low row of
sandy buttes half a mile to the south and ahead were
speeding a bevy of dark dots. Davy’s heart skipped
a beat. The dots were making for the trail, as if to
cut off the coach. They were Indians, sure.</p>

<p>“What’ll we do, Waupsie?” asked Ben, coolly.
“Beat ’em in?”</p>

<p>“We’ll do the best we can. Six miles to go is all,”
answered Waupsie, in grim manner. And he yelled
to the cavalrymen: “You’ll have to ride faster than
that, boys.”</p>

<p>The corporal in charge of the squad had spoken
gruffly. Three before, three behind, the soldiers were
rising and falling in their stirrups and urging on their
horses. The grade was slightly down hill, and it was
evident that the cavalry horses were no match for the
stage team—six splendid blacks, grain fed and long-legged.
Soon the coach gradually drew even with the
leading soldiers and began to pass them in spite of their
efforts.</p>

<p>“Can’t wait,” yelled Waupsie, “Goodby. Fact
is,” he remarked, half to himself, “I can’t hold ’em.
Drat their skins!”</p>

<p>The whoops of the Indians were plainly heard; the
breeze was from the south, and as if smelling the red
enemy the stage horses were wild with fear. Braced,
Waupsie sawed on the lines; his foot pressed the brake
hard, but he might as well have saved his strength.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333"></a>[333]</span></p>

<p>Waupsie had no time or opportunity to use a gun;
his business was to drive. Ben cocked his shot-gun
lying across his knees.</p>

<p>“Get in the boot, Dave,” he bade.</p>

<p>Davy started to slide under, but stopped ashamed.
In a rush the Indians, whooping and frantically brandishing
bows and lances, charged the trail, cutting in
behind, and racing on both sides before. The cavalry
squad were now far in the rear.</p>

<p>With a thud an arrow landed full in the coach side;
another quivered in the flank of the off wheel horse—and
he leaped prodigiously.</p>

<p>“Steady! Steady, boys!” besought Waupsie.</p>

<p>The arrows were hissing and thudding. The
painted Indians looked like demons. Ben flung up his
gun, took hasty aim, and at the report the nearest
Indian on the left (a particularly determined fellow)
swerved away, reeling in his saddle pad. Red spots
could be seen on his side where the buck-shot had
struck. At the rear the cavalrymen were shooting
vainly, and suddenly Waupsie gave an exclamation.</p>

<p>“Take these lines, quick!” he said. “Confound
it!”</p>

<p>An arrow had pinned his right arm to his side. He
jerked at it and could not budge it, and Ben grabbed
the lines.</p>

<p>“You take my gun, Dave,” he ordered. “Don’t
shoot unless you have to; and then shoot the ponies.
Fight ’em off.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334"></a>[334]</span></p>

<p>Dave promptly seized the gun from Ben’s lap, and
at once he saw the reason in the last order. The Indians
were racing on either side; whenever he raised
the gun to aim every Indian on that side ducked to the
opposite flank of his horse, and left only a moccasin
sole in sight. That was a small mark at which to aim
from a jolting coach. Dave aimed and aimed again;
whenever he paused, up bobbed the Indians; when he
pointed the gun at them, down they ducked; and all
the time they were shooting from underneath their
ponies’ necks or from the saddle.</p>

<p>“<a href="#i_fp334">That’s right. Fight ’em off, Davy.</a> It’s as good
as emptying your gun,” panted Ben, hanging hard to
the lines. Waupsie was plying the whip—now and
then to drop it and level his revolver.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_fp334">
  <img src="images/i_fp334.jpg"  alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><a href="#Page_334">“THAT’S RIGHT. FIGHT ’EM OFF, DAVY”</a></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>“Fight ’em off, Davy!”</p>

<p>A sharp shock almost paralyzed Dave’s right arm,
and through shoulder and arm surged a red-hot pain.
He nearly dropped the gun. He glanced at his shoulder
and saw a flush of crimson dyeing his shirt. But no
arrow was sticking there as he had feared. It was
only a gash. All right.</p>

<p>“Hurt, Dave?” queried Ben.</p>

<p>“No, not much,” said Davy, firmly.</p>

<p>“We’ll make it,” uttered Waupsie. “Got to.
Fight ’em off, boys!”</p>

<p>The sandy plain flowed past; another horse had
been wounded and the coach was fairly bristling with
shafts. But the gallant team never slackened their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335"></a>[335]</span>
furious pace, and suddenly with a final chorus of
whoops and a last volley, the Indians turned and raced
away; for yonder, around the turn, appeared the home
station.</p>

<p>“Humph!” muttered Waupsie. “Those Injuns
are just on a lark. Now I’ll get quit of this arrow.”</p>

<p>The cavalry squad did not arrive until after the
coach had left; another squad escorted it to Fort
Kearney, and by the time Atchison was reached, two
days afterward, Dave’s shoulder was beginning to
heal.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t hurt much, really, Ben,” he insisted;
but he was proud of his wound. The scar he carries
to-day and other scars besides.</p>

<p>From Atchison he and Ben went down to Leavenworth.
On the street at Leavenworth a hand clapped
him on his shoulder (fortunately his well shoulder),
and looking up he looked into the face of Billy Cody.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XXIV">XXIV<br />
<small>BUFFALO BILL IS CHAMPION</small></h2>
</div>


<p>It was not “Little Billy Cody” now—the slender
boy whose boots had seemed too large for him even
when he was riding Pony Express. It was “Scout
Cody”—a man with wide, piercing brown eyes, long
wavy yellow hair, a silky light-brown moustache, a
pair of broad shoulders above a wiry waist, and an
alert, springy step. But he was “Billy Cody” after all.</p>

<p>He and Wild Bill Hickok had been serving together
with the Union army in Missouri and Arkansas; and
now he was at Leavenworth on a furlough from detached
duty at St. Louis.</p>

<p>He could give Davy only a half hour; Davy heard
some of his adventures and learned also that “Mother
Cody” had gone (what a brave, sweet woman she had
been!), and that the Cody home in Salt Creek Valley
had been broken up. Truly, the West was undergoing
great changes.</p>

<p>Greater changes still occurred in the next three
years. Dave entered West Point in June of the next
summer, 1865, and for the succeeding two years he
studied hard. When he was given his furlough he
spent part of it with General Brown, who, luckily, was
stationed at Fort Leavenworth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337"></a>[337]</span></p>

<p>The two years at the Military Academy had formed
a different boy of Dave. The strict discipline had
taught him how to make the most of his time, and the
constant drill exercises had straightened him up and
trained all his muscles as well as his mind. He felt
quite like a man as he shook hands with the general
and met his approving eye.</p>

<p>One of his first questions to the general, after the
greetings and polite inquiries, was about Billy Cody.</p>

<p>“‘Billy’ Cody, you say?” laughed the general.
“Haven’t you been reading the papers?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I haven’t, general,” confessed Dave.
“We don’t have much time to read the papers at the
Academy, you know.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” chuckled the general. “You don’t.
But your friend and mine, Billy Cody, has a new name.
He’s now ‘Buffalo Bill.’ He’s been supplying buffalo
meat to the grading contractors on the Kansas Pacific.
They need about twelve buffalo a day, and he took the
job for $500 a month. It’s been a dangerous business,
and he hunts alone out on the plains, with one
man following in a wagon to do the butchering and
load the meat, and the Indians are always trying to get
Bill’s scalp. So far he’s outwitted them, and he’s been
bringing in the meat so regularly that at night when
he rides in the boys in the camps yell: ‘Here comes
old Bill with more buffalo!’ and ‘Buffalo Bill’ he is.
He’s been married, too, you know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338"></a>[338]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, has he?” And Dave spoke impulsively.
“I’d like to see him mighty well.”</p>

<p>“You can. The railroad’s running trains about
500 miles west from the river, nearly to Sheridan, and
you’ve got here just in time to go along with us and
see a big contest between Buffalo Bill and Billy Comstock,
the chief of scouts at Fort Wallace there.
They’re to hunt buffalo together for eight hours, and
the one who kills the most wins a nice little purse of
$500, gold. Billy Comstock is a fine young fellow, a
great hunter and a crack shot—but I’ll back Buffalo
Bill.”</p>

<p>So, thought Dave, loyally, would he, too.</p>

<p>The contest had excited great interest. An excursion
for friends of the rivals and for sight-seers
was to be run clear through from St. Louis. Every
army officer and soldier who could leave was going
from Fort Leavenworth. Leader of all was General
George A. Custer, the famous “Boy General with the
Golden Locks” (as during the war the newspapers
had called him), who with his fighting Seventh Cavalry
had arrived at Fort Leavenworth after a summer’s
campaign on the plains. Of course, everybody in army
circles knew about General Custer, the dashing cavalryman,
with his curling yellow hair and his crimson tie.
Introduced to him by General Brown, Dave blushed
and stammered and felt that he must cut a very poor
figure.</p>

<p>It seemed strange that a railroad actually was on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339"></a>[339]</span>
its way across the plains. In fact, there were two railroads
jutting out from the Missouri River for the
farther West. Northward from Omaha the celebrated
Union Pacific had built clear to Julesburg, and
was hustling along to Utah at the rate of five and six
miles a day. It followed the old Overland Trail up
the Platte, and ate the stages as it progressed.</p>

<p>Here at the southward the Kansas Pacific, or
“Eastern Division” of the Union Pacific, was reaching
westward out of Leavenworth for Denver. It
followed the Smoky Hill Fork Trail taken by the Hee-Haw
Express—the memorable outfit of Dave’s and
Billy’s and Mr. Baxter’s, and all, to the “Pike’s Peak
Country” and the “Cherry Creek diggin’s.” Yes, it
did seem strange to Dave to be riding that trail in a
train of cars drawn by a snorting steam-engine and
crowded with laughing, shouting people—travelling in
an hour a distance that would have required from the
Hee-Haw Express a day, perhaps! But the Hee-Haw
Express had not been such a bad experience after all,
and it had been fun as well as work.</p>

<p>Gracious, how Kansas had settled! The Salt Creek
Valley, people said, was all taken up by farms. The
railroad route from Leavenworth down to the Kansas
River at Lawrence certainly passed through nothing
but farms and settlements, and on up the Kansas to
the Smoky Hill Fork at Junction City all the country
was farms, farms, farms, punctuated by towns and
cities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340"></a>[340]</span></p>

<p>Along the Smoky Hill Fork trail a number of new
forts had been established, protecting the way for the
railroad. First beyond Fort Riley, which Davy remembered
from the time when the Hee-Haws passed
it, was Fort Harker, next would come Fort Hays, and
then Fort Wallace near Sheridan.</p>

<p>The train left Leavenworth early in the morning;
the run to the end of the track would take about
twenty-five hours, with stops for meals. It would
appear, from the looks of the country between Lawrence
and Junction City across the river from Fort
Riley, that there were no more wild Indians and buffalo;
but westward from Junction City things suddenly
changed; and when Dave awakened from a brief
doze here were the same old brown plains again, ready
for the bull whacker, the stage coach, the buffalo and
the Indians.</p>

<p>The train was jammed with all kinds of people
from St. Louis, Kansas City, Leavenworth, Lawrence,
Topeka—everybody having a good time. In the last
car were Mrs. Cody and little daughter Arta. Davy
had a glimpse of her—a handsome woman with glowing
dark eyes. Buffalo Bill had met her during the
war, in St. Louis, and they had been married two years
now. She and little Arta and General Custer were
the main attraction on the whole train.</p>

<p>The train was a travelling arsenal. At the front
end of Davy’s car was a stand containing twenty-five
breech-loading rifles and a large chest of cartridges,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341"></a>[341]</span>
with the lid opened. The conductor (who, people
said, was an old Indian fighter) wore two revolvers
at his waist, and carried his rifle from car to car.
Almost every man was armed with some sort of a gun,
and all the passengers and train crew were constantly
on the lookout for “Injuns” and buffalo. As the
train roared onward further into the plains, its snorty,
busy little engine sounded five short whistles. Out
from the windows down the line of coaches were thrust
heads. Men who had no gun made a rush for the
stand of arms, and grabbed rifles and cartridges.</p>

<p>“Buffalo! Buffalo!”</p>

<p>“Where? Quick!”</p>

<p>“There they go!”</p>

<p>“Where? Oh, I see them!”</p>

<p>“Mercy, what monsters!”</p>

<p>There were people aboard who actually never had
seen a buffalo.</p>

<p>“What beards!”</p>

<p>“Are those really buffalo?”</p>

<p>“Shoot!”</p>

<p>“Conductor! Stop the train!”</p>

<p>Bang! Bangity-bang! Bang! Bang! Everybody
who could get a glimpse poked his gun out of a
window and fired. Two big buffalo bulls were racing
the train; heads down, tails up, trying to cross in front
of it. The rain of bullets had not touched them. One
crossed; but the other suddenly whirled on the track
and charged the engine. The cow-catcher lifted him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342"></a>[342]</span>
high—Davy had sight of his great shaggy shape turning
a somersault in the air, and funny enough he
looked, too, with mane and tail flying. He landed with
a thump; people laughed so that they forgot to shoot
again until too late; and gazing back Davy was glad
to witness him scramble to his feet, shake himself, and
glare after the train and bellow defiance.</p>

<p>It struck Dave as rather of a shame to pepper the
buffalo from the windows of a moving train—which,
he heard, sometimes did not even stop to make use
of the meat, but left the carcasses lying for the wolves.
Dusk soon settled, so that there was little more shooting.
With a stop for water and supper, on through
the darkness rumbled the train. The passengers slept
in their seats—an uncomfortable way, but they did
not mind. Judging from the looks of Forts Harker
and Hays, which were merely log cabins with sod
roofs, the cars were the best place.</p>

<p>The talk among the passengers was mainly of buffalo
and of the Indians (who had been fighting the
advance of the railroad through their hunting-grounds),
and of the match between Buffalo Bill Cody
and Scout Will Comstock.</p>

<p>As for Will Comstock, the people said that he was
a young fellow with the figure of a mere boy and the
face of a girl—but that no braver scout ever rode the
plains. However, Billy Cody seemed to have the majority.
He had been making a great record since the
war. He had driven stage for a little while on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343"></a>[343]</span>
Overland Trail; then he had married; and soon he was
scouting again for the army on the Smoky Hill Trail.
He had guided General Custer on a dangerous trip
out of Fort Harker, and had been guide and dispatch
bearer out of Fort Hays, and nobody except Wild Bill
(who was a scout on this line, too) was thought to be
quite his equal.</p>

<p>Almost as famous as Buffalo Bill were his buffalo
horse, Brigham, and his rifle, Lucretia; against these
three Billy Comstock, good as he was, did not stand
much show.</p>

<p>It was a jolly excursion crowd this: soldiers and
civilians, city people and country people, residents and
tourists, men, women and some children, all packed
tight and bent on seeing the “big match” advertised
to take place between Buffalo Bill Cody and Will
Comstock, the other famous scout.</p>

<p>Early in the morning the tracks ended about twenty
miles this side of Sheridan. And here, on the open
prairie, were gathered an astonishing amount of vehicles,
animals and horsemen. The spot looked like a
land opening—or a picnic. Davy recognized Billy
Cody at once.</p>

<p>With a group of army officers, scouts in buckskin,
and other horsemen, Billy was sitting on his horse at
the edge of the mass of carriages. The train-load of
excursionists fairly burst from the cars, even climbing
out through the windows, and made a rush for the
vehicles. Davy forged ahead for Billy Cody. Billy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344"></a>[344]</span>
had left his horse and when Davy saw him next he was
gallantly escorting his wife and little daughter to an
army ambulance; as he came back Dave caught him.</p>

<p>“Hello, Billy.”</p>

<p>“By thunder! That name sounds familiar,
Dave! Well, I’m certainly glad to see you.”</p>

<p>They gripped hands. As Buffalo Bill, Billy looked
older than he had as Scout Cody, even, during the war.
His face had been bronzed deeper by hard plains
riding, day and night, and on his firm chin he wore a
little goatee. His suit of Indian tanned buckskin was
beaded and fringed, and fitted him to perfection. A
fine figure of a man he was, too; every inch of him.</p>

<p>There was little time to exchange greetings or
words. Everything was confusion—and the day
would soon pass.</p>

<p>“Go in and win, Billy.”</p>

<p>“You bet I will, Dave.”</p>

<p>And with that Billy strode hastily back to his
horse—brushing by the many hands held out to stay
him a moment.</p>

<p>The match was to last from eight in the morning
to four in the afternoon if buffalo could be found.
Slim and active, and as picturesque as Buffalo Bill
himself, General Custer, from horseback, announced
in a loud voice that the spectators were to follow the
hunters until the herd was sighted and then must stay
behind so as not to alarm the buffalo, until the shooting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345"></a>[345]</span>
had begun. After that they might go as near as
they pleased.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill and Scout Comstock led away; behind
them rode the horsemen, chiefly scouts and army officers.
A large bunch of cavalry mounts had been sent
out from Fort Wallace, near Sheridan, for the visitor
officers, and Davy (who was almost an officer) was
accorded the courtesy of one. So he was well fixed.
Trailing the horsemen came the excursionists in army
ambulances and old coaches and spring wagons and
even buggies—raked and scraped from far and near.</p>

<p>Thus they all proceeded across the rolling prairie.
The scene resembled a picnic more than ever.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill, the talk said, was riding Brigham, his
favorite buffalo runner—and a scrubby looking horse
Brigham was, too, for a hunter and a racer. Billy’s
gun was a heavy, long-barrelled single-shot—a breech-loading
Springfield army gun of fifty calibre.</p>

<p>Will Comstock was apparently much better
mounted and better armed. His horse was a strong,
active, spirited black, and his gun was a Henry repeating
carbine. He himself seemed a young fellow
to be chief of scouts at Fort Wallace; his face was
smooth and fair, his eyes roundly blue, and his waist
was as small as a girl’s.</p>

<p>Suddenly Buffalo Bill raised his hand; and at the
instant a hum of excitement welled from the crowd.
There were some buffalo—there, about a mile ahead
on the right, a good-sized herd, peacefully grazing.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346"></a>[346]</span>
Away sped Buffalo Bill and Scout Comstock and two
other horsemen, to get to the windward. The two
other horsemen were the referees, one to accompany
each hunter and keep tab on him.</p>

<p>The rest of the crowd followed slowly, so as to give
the hunters plenty of time to begin.</p>

<p>On and on spurred the group of four. They
swerved for the buffalo herd; and separating, as if by
agreement, into pairs, dashed into the herd that way—Buffalo
Bill and his referee on the right, Scout Comstock
and his referee on the left. As soon as the first
shot echoed back across the prairie, the cry went up:
“They’re in! They’re in!” and wildly excited,
straight for the field broke the eager spectators.</p>

<p>The wagons jounced and bounded, the horses and
mules snorted, women screamed, men shouted—and
better equipped than those other excursionists, on horseback
amidst his army friends Davy forged to the
front.</p>

<p>When they arrived the contest was well under way.
Scout Comstock had ridden almost out of sight, pelting
along and shooting into the rear of his bunch. He
had left a trail of dead buffalo, as if he had made every
shot count. Buffalo Bill, however, was right here,
working by a different system. Evidently he had
hastened to the head of his bunch first, and turned them—until
now he had them all actually running in a
small circle. He was riding around the outside at an
easy lope on Brigham, and steadily firing, oftentimes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347"></a>[347]</span>
without raising his gun from across the saddle horn.</p>

<p>Brigham’s bridle lines were hanging loose. He
needed no guiding. He knew just what was to be done.
He loped to the side of a buffalo and stayed there a
moment until the gun went “Bang!” Then, even before
the buffalo had fallen, he loped on to another, put
his master in good position, and at the report of the
rifle continued to the next!</p>

<p>“A wonderful horse! A wonderful horse!”
ejaculated General Brown. “Why, teach that horse
to shoot and he wouldn’t need a rider. Bill could sit
and look on!”</p>

<p>“He nurses the buffalo together and all Bill has to
do is to load and fire. He scarcely needs to aim,” said
another officer.</p>

<p>Presently Buffalo Bill had shot down every buffalo
in the bunch; there were thirty-eight, dead as doornails.
When Bill Comstock returned, his horse blown,
from chasing his bunch as far as he could, his referee
reported twenty-three as that count.</p>

<p>The horses were rested until another herd appeared.
Out of this Buffalo Bill killed eighteen with the help
of old Brigham, and Billy Comstock killed fourteen.
So at noon the score stood: Buffalo Bill (and
Brigham), fifty-six; Billy Comstock only thirty-seven.</p>

<p>Luncheon was spread out on the prairie by the excursionists
and everybody ate. The opinion was that
Buffalo Bill had won; Billy Comstock never could catch
up—not even if they traded horses!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348"></a>[348]</span></p>

<p>After luncheon Buffalo Bill suddenly stood, and,
going to Brigham, quickly stripped him of saddle and
bridle.</p>

<p>“Ladies and gentlemen,” announced Billy, “in
order to give my friend Comstock a chance I’m going
to finish my hunt without saddle and bridle—and
even then I’ll wager I’ll down more buffalo than he
will.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Cody! Please don’t!” begged one of
the women excursionists, who had been nervous all
along. “You’ll certainly be hurt.”</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill smiled and shook his head.</p>

<p>“There’s not the slightest cause for alarm,” he
said. “I’ve ridden this way many a time. Old
Brigham knows as well as I what’s to be done—and
sometimes a great deal better.”</p>

<p>Riding thus without saddle and bridle, out of the
next herd Buffalo Bill, so cleverly guided by Brigham,
easily killed thirteen more buffaloes. The last he drove
with a rush straight toward the spectators, and laughed
as he downed it almost at their feet. Slipping from
his bareback seat, he doffed his hat and bowed.</p>

<p>“You see?” he bade.</p>

<p>Scout Comstock came in with a count of only nine.</p>

<p>“I’m done,” he said frankly. “How many in all,
Bill?”</p>

<p>“Sixty-nine.”</p>

<p>“Forty-six here.” And he shrugged his slender
shoulders. “Well, Bill, you’re a wonder. There’s not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349"></a>[349]</span>
another man on the plains could have done it. Ladies
and gentlemen,” he called, “three cheers for Buffalo
Bill Cody, the boy ‘extra,’ the kid express rider, the
champion buffalo hunter, and the best man that ever
rode the plains.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The excursion train returned that night, and Davy
returned with it. But Buffalo Bill stayed out on the
plains, scouting for the army against the Indians.
Davy kept track of him, for the name of “Buffalo
Bill,” dispatch bearer and guide, was constantly in the
papers. When in June, 1869, Davy graduated from
the Military Academy, and soon was assigned to the
Fifth Cavalry in Nebraska, Buffalo Bill had been appointed
by General Phil Sheridan as chief of scouts
to serve with it.</p>

<p>This spring the Union Pacific Railway had met the
Central Pacific Railway in Utah and the tracks joined.
The Overland Trail had been spanned at last by iron
rails; but there was still much work to be done to make
the plains safe for the settler, his home, his church and
his school-house; and helping to do it, Dave and
Buffalo Bill often rode together, man and man.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
